Bob Annderson: Coolest guy ever? Try telling that to Alan Greenspan.
Captain Holt: Nice burn, Bob!''',
          '''Jake: That was 18 days ago. He's getting saner by the minute. In a month, he'll basically just be Frasier.

Jake: Copy that.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Bingpot!''',
          '''Charles: I gotta say. You guys are good cops.

Charles: By never being promoted and losing all your money to divorces.
Scully: And bad investments.''',

Jake: Or did I save your life?
Sergeant Jeffords: Or did you compromise an investigation and piss off a superior officer?!

Hitchcock: Can't spill food on your shirt if you're not wearing one.''',

Captain Holt: Look, Gina, is that a talking raisin?
Madeline Wuntch: Enough foreplay.''',

Charles: Never happened.
Scully: Well, someone said it to me last night. Oh, must have been my wife.''',

Captain Holt: Oh, no, I've already consumed the required calories for this day period.
Rosa: Yummy.''',
          '''Jake: You guys, this is gonna be fine. I mean Terry's our boss and he comes with us every year.
Sergeant Jeffords: Correction, you bring Vacation Terry, and he is no man's boss. When the slippers are filled, Terry is chilled.''',
          '''Gina: Jake, why don't you just do the right thing and jump out a window? Captain Holt will never fire me if he knows I'm mourning the death of a close friend.''',
          '''Madeline Wuntch: I'm the front-runner for a job in the Boston PD.
Captain Holt: Boston? But it's so close to Salem. You do know what they do to witches up there, don't you?''',

Amy: Speech!
Captain Holt: That was my speech.
Amy: Short & sweet.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Damn Jake, you know Terry loves love. I'm in.''',

Amy: How do they defecate?
Sergeant Jeffords: It's a kid's book, Santiago!''',
          '''Charles: You talking oldest bags? Sixty-eight.
Amy: That's not that old.
Charles: No, but I was only twenty.
Jake: Were you even a cop then?
Charles: No, man. It was before I got into the academy.
Rosa: Charles isn't talking about his oldest arrest.
Everybody: Ew!''',
          '''Jake: I have a murder here with no leads and no evidence. It's unsolvable, and thus, shall have no paperwork.
Hitchcock: You had me at "no paperwork".
Jake: That was the very end of the sentence.''',
          '''Jake: Captain, hey! Welcome to the murder.''',
          '''Jake: Amy, check it out.
Amy: Nice! You got it framed?
Jake: Of course. It commemorates our victory over the Vulture, the greatest day in human history. Sorry the tear gas made you look like a demon dog at the end of Ghostbusters.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Diaz, are we still on for the polar bear swim tonight?
Rosa: It's either that or go carolling with my family, so yeah. I'd rather walk into the freezing ocean.''',
          '''Rosa: You all right, Captain? Tough weekend?
Captain Holt: I went to Barbados with my husband. We wove hats out of palm fronds and swam with the stingrays. I've never been happier.''',
          '''Jake: So, I'm going to grab a healthy breakfast.
Captain Holt: Are those gummy bears wrapped in a fruit roll-up?
Jake: Breakfast burrito, but yeah.
Captain Holt: I pity your dentist.
Jake: Joke's on you. I don't have a dentist.''',
          '''Cory: It was like taking candy from a baby.
Sergeant Jeffords: Why are you giving candy to a baby in the first place? Don't give candy to a baby! They can't brush their teeth!''',
          '''Captain Holt: Oh, look at that. An alert. I'm probably trending already. What? My account has been deactivated?
Gina: Twitter thinks you're a bot.
Captain Holt: Why? I am a human. I am a human male.''',
          '''Captain Holt: You're looking at a suspension, maybe worse. Unless you can track down Doug Judy and recover those diamonds.
Jake: Can they wait 12 months? I usually run into him about once a year.''',
          '''Scully: I miss my home chair.
Rosa: You miss a chair?''',
          '''Rosa: And now I don't know what to do.

Rosa: Thanks, Amy. (leaves the room)
Amy: I have no idea what she's gonna do but that's the safest way to give Rosa advice.
Sergeant Jeffords: Yep.''',
          '''Jake: But my point is this: I don't care what time it is. I'm always happy to be here. Nine-Nine! Nine-Niiine! A-Noine-Noine! I'm gonna keep doing it until you guys chime in. A-Noine-Noine!''',

Gina: Charles, going in the wrong direction and getting himself disqualified. Interesting approach.''',
          '''Gina: The only reason I didn't tell you is I don't value you as people, so why be honest?''',
          '''Gina: Breakups are a cartoony thumbs down. They make people feel face-with-Xs-for-the-eyes.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Bad news. I only found his wife, and she hasn't heard from him in eight years.
Jake: That doesn't sound good.
Sergeant Jeffords: Yeah, that's why I started by saying, "Bad News". Terry believes in having a clear topic sentence.''',
          '''Jake: I'm talking to my credit card company. I tried to get an online subscription to the New Yorker and they declined me. Apparently, based on my previous purchases, they assumed it was fraud. That's crazy. I'm fancy. One time I had coffee-flavored ice cream.''',
          '''Amy: I passed a slutty tree on the way here. Who wants to have sex with a tree?
Scully: Was it a maple?''',
          '''Jake: You did it, Fuzzy. You busted 'em. It's time to come home. "I'm not sure if I can. I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am. I've seen terrible things. I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons."''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: He makes me feel so small!

Jake: Uh, piñatas.
Rosa: Glow sticks.
Jake: Karate boards.
Rosa: Spaghetti when you have a small pot.
Jake: Rules.''',

Captain Holt: Constantly.''',

Gina: Honestly, I'm going to last forever. You hear that bitches? I'm gonna last forever.''',
          '''Gina: I did a little sleuthing on your rivals. You want me to spill the beans?

Captain Holt: Well, you should close it, lest you get moths. Good day.''',

Jake: No.
Charles: Lillian Wayne.''',
          '''Jake: Well, listen, we need your help.

Adrian Pimento:What? Really?
Rosa: No.''',

Kevin:Yes.

Rosa: Possibly. My immune system is too weak to fight off my smile muscles.''',
          '''Jake: That's so bitter. What's wrong with this chocolate milk?
Store Owner: Dark milk isn't chocolate milk. This is teet-to-mouth raw cow's milk. The bitterness of the chocolate brings out the sourness in the milk.
Jake: That's the worst part of both of those things.''',
          '''Doctor: We weren't able to do the procedure. Your friend is so large-
Jake: That you needed a bigger saw to cut through his dingus.''',
          '''Charles: Thing is, it's so hard to talk at work because there's no privacy. The roof is freezing, the holding cell is full of perps, and their romantic advice is not great. It's always to tell Vivian, "bitch, get your life right!" I tried it. She did not like it.''',

Jake: I can't tell if you're being serious.''',
          '''Rosa: I've only said I love you to three people. My mom, my dad and my dying grandpa. And one of those I regret.
Charles: Which one?
Rosa: Grandpa. He beat cancer so now I look like an idiot.''',
          '''Rosa: Thank you, Carlene. Your entire life is garbage.''',
          '''Captain Holt: So Diaz, I figured out why you wanna win. I hacked your work calendar.
Rosa: Those calendars are public. Everyone on the system has access.
Captain Holt: I hacked it. I'm a hacker.''',
          '''Jake: Hitchcock, can you top it?
Hitchcock: Mine has mother's hospital bed.
Amy: Okay, Scully?
Scully: I got this one red door I've never been able to open and I hear screams behind it sometimes. But it's probably just the wind.
Jake: Okay, that's actually too scary.''',
          '''Charles: No! I was eavesdropping. I'm always eavesdropping.
Jake: I don't like it.

Amy: [flashback] [GASPS] There's a typo in this crossword puzzle.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Well-
Amy: Uh-

Charles: Why did you wake me up?! I told you never to wake me up!''',

Jake: Are you blind? We're vibing like crazy.
Captain Holt: I assure you, my mother's not a vibrator.
Jake: Definitely not what that's short for.''',

Jake: No, he didn't. He's her lover. He's your mother's lover. He's lovering your mother.''',

Kevin: Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
Captain Holt: And now it's a scene.''',

Jake: That's your Holt impression?
Charles: I can hear him doing that.''',

Carly: Whatever.
Captain Holt: Carly will be the first to go.''',

Charles: No! Objection!
Judge: On what grounds?
Charles: That's my penis?
Judge: Overruled.''',
          '''Amy: I got five down. I figured out the theme. It's boats.
Doug Judy: Okay, I get it. She's smart and lovable; you're scrappy and lovable; together you're just lovable and lovable.''',
          '''Captain Holt: So you lied to me? Out of pity. You pity me.
Jake: I wouldn't put it that way.
Captain Holt: I would. I am offended. I am angry. I am very tired. So I'm gonna take a nap, but when I wake up, oh, you are in for it.''',
          '''Amy: Okay, let's talk planets. Jupiter is a gas giant.
Gina: So's Hitchcock. How does this help me?''',

Amy: My lip-reading is not flawless.''',

Charles: Pillow talk alert. Set the scene, spooning or face to face?
Jake: Charles.
Charles: Spooning.''',

*Audience groans*
Don't boo me! I lost something important too, shoot!''',
          '''Jake: That's not what I meant. No, we have to fight her.
Captain Holt: We're not going to fight her. She's the devil. And you don't dance with the devil because you get burned. Also, because in Madeline's case she has no rhythm, and her hands are like little rat claws.''',
          '''Charles: You're useless. You are completely useless. You are, without a doubt, the most incompetent detectives I've ever seen. And I am including that bomb sniffing dog that humps all the bombs.''',
          '''Gina: Give me the ring.
Jake: You sound like Gollum.
Gina: That means nothing to me. I don't see those movies, I'm too pretty.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Maybe I should wing it. Love, it sustains you. It's like oatmeal.
Sergeant Jeffords: Okay. Okay. Not bad for winging it.
Captain Holt: I lied. Took me two hours to write that.''',
          '''Hitchock: Looks like Boyle's out and Hitchcock's in. What do you want to do tonight? Go to a strip club? Have dinner with my wife?
Jake: Are those separate options, or does she live at the strip club?
Hitchcock: You wanna know, you gotta go.''',
          '''Jake: You work for the post office. Your motto is surprisingly, we exist.
Jack Danger: Incorrect. Our motto is "nos custodimus quod lingus". We guard what you lick.
Jake: That's worse!''',
          '''Jake: All right, I'm gonna win this case and then we can put my horrible sexual experience behind us forever.
Charles: I don't know Jake. I'm afraid I'm gonna think about it every time I look at your crotch.
Jake: Then stop looking at my crotch!''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Apparently he's on an important call with the Albanian president.
Amy: Is that Bujar Nishani or is it still Bamir Topi?
Gina: Oh, Ames, let me check. Mmm, it just says no one likes you.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: I guess I didn't really think of you as that kind of friend.
Jake: Sarge, I'm every kind of friend. I'm Phoebe, I'm Chandler, I'm Rachel, I'm - who's the dinosaur guy?
Sergeant Jeffords: Ross, bro. Ross!
Jake: Sorry, I forgot you were such a Ross head.''',
          '''Gina: Forget your ex with meaningless sex. It rhymes because it's true.''',
          '''Gina: It's so addictive, right? I play so much that when I close my eyes at night, I just see cupcakes instead of my normal dizzying array of flashing lights.''',
          '''Jake: When it comes to shooting patterns, I like to go PB&J. Penis, Brain, Jaw.''',

Eric: That will be $1,600.

Kevin: "Needled him a new suit." Even when we're fighting, you're hilarious. Stop it. Stop it.''',
          '''Gina: Captain, turn your greatest weakness into your greatest strength. Like Paris Hilton, re: sex tape.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I'm considering it. I'm interested. I agree to participate.''',

          '''Captain Holt: To catching a serial killer.
Jake: To catching a serial killer.
Gina: To Rihanna, because I love Rihanna.''',

          '''Captain Holt: Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me. Though you were significantly-

Captain Holt: You have a friend, who's just a silhouette?
Sergeant Jeffords: Yes!''',

          '''Charles: What is all this?
Amy: You know how I think Halloween is for jerks? Well, this Halloween, I was the jerk. I'm sorry about tonight.
Jake: "I'm sorry about tonight." We found the title for Santiago's follow-up sex tape!''',
          '''Rosa: Right, that's the guy you said the lame stuff about. Like he's a good listener.
Amy: Sorry, what do you look for in a guy?
Rosa: Real stuff, like the shape of his ass.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Aren't you standing right next to him?
Captain Holt: This bitch? Please.''',

Captain Holt: I hate cliches.
Amy: Cliches are the worst.''',

Captain Holt: Now say "punk."
Jake: Punk.
Captain Holt: Punk!
Jake: I said it.''',
          '''Jake: We can deal with this. We just need a new plan.
Amy: I got it. We lie, tell him we broke up, then date in secret.
Jake: Great! And you'd be okay lying to your captain?
Amy: Okay, new plan.''',
          '''Gina: Whatcha doing there, Boyle?
Charles: Trying to get drunk enough to have sexual intercourse with a vegan. Why can't I just think with my junk like a modern man?''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Fine. You can work the case from right here, but you are tied to your desk.
Jake: Tied to my desk? Mr. Grey will see you now, Sarge.''',
          '''Charles: Try being more descriptive. I know you love Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches. Why?
Captain Holt: Their components have a long shelf life, they're cost effective, and they're so simple a child could make them.''',
          '''Jack Danger: There are five people responsible for key collection in the city.
Jake: Boom! That's our list of suspects. We shall call them the fellowship of the key.
Charles: I honestly think you are the greatest man who ever lived.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: That's not what a vasectomy is.''',
          '''Jake: Yes! The Ebony Falcon soars again.
Charles: The Ebony Falcon. His feathers are muscles.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Urgh, what's in these?
Amy: Potatoes, butter, a little milk. Oh, and I ran out of salt, so I used baking soda.
Sergeant Jeffords: Why wouldn't you? They're both white powders. Of course they're interchangeable.
Amy: Yeah.''',
          '''Jake: Actually, sir, I think we were kind of hoping we could work the case together.
Captain Holt: Oh, are you two no longer-
Jake: Smooshing booties?
Captain Holt: Yes, that's exactly how I was gonna finish my sentence.
Jake: Figured.''',
          '''Gina: Hold it up. You're gonna let some quack doctor just knife around down there? You are blessed with a great power, and you should never snip its wings. You should let it soar.''',

          '''Captain Holt: (At cinema to see Moneyball) The statistical analysis. (Sobs) It's so beautiful.''',

Mlepnos: Yes, the "clay" is silent.''',

Jake: No.''',

Jake: So what you're saying is, we need to talk about Kevin. *Everybody boos* I have no regrets!''',

Charles: Nice. The dark web. It's the only place you can buy quality bat meat.''',
          '''Charles: And now Nikolaj says he's too frightened to ever sleep again, so that's just superduper.
Adrian Pimento: I don't understand what he's so scared about. If I was there to kill him, he never would've heard me.
Charles: A thing you told him several times.''',
          '''Captain Holt: White rice, brown rice. Those are just some of the rices I love.
Bob Annderson: Mmm.

Bob Annderson: Mmm.

          '''Jake: Wait, getting a text. It's Captain Holt.
Rosa: Where is he? What'd he say?
Jake: "Inib rue tiid." Wait, I'm getting another one. "Ink obrvs whiz." These are nonsense.
Scully: He's been gagged.
Jake: How would that come through in a text, Scully?''',
          '''Charles: Oh, hey, can I borrow that? Genevieve's out of town. I need two phones so I can send her a "frontie" and a "backie."
Gina: I don't want your ass in my cloud.''',
          '''Jake: Sarge, Sarge, Sarge. You know that I'm your guy for this. You can't give a celebrity case to Amy. The last movie she saw was a documentary about spelling bees.
Amy: Wrong. It was about the font Helvetica, and it played like an action thriller.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Sir, you have a pretty low bar for what you consider drama. Once, I used an exclamation point in a email. You called me Diana Ross.
Captain Holt: I assure you, in this case, I do not exaggerate.''',
          '''Jake: This might just be the fever talking, but this unedited footage of an Italian restaurant from eight years ago might be the best movie I've ever seen. Also, how weird are forks?
Captain Holt: Forks are very weird. I've always thought so.''',

Hitchcock: That's correct.''',
          '''Rosa: See, Sarge? Tough love works.
Sergeant Jeffords: Damn it! Terry proved the wrong point.''',

Captain Holt: Sergeant, are you familiar with the Hungarian fencing term, Hossz Gorcs?
Sergeant Jeffords: You must realize my answer is no.''',

Jake: You kind of interrupted an incredible moment, but here, take that.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Until this morning, some part of me still believed I would be captain of the Nine-Nine again. What a fool I was. I should never have returned. It's like visiting your childhood home and seeing it's been replaced by a denim pants store.''',

Madeline Wuntch: Call me the devil, Raymond? How original.
Captain Holt: Actually, I was calling you a goat. You goat.''',

Hitchcock: That's not a crime scene. That's a boudouir photo I'm having framed for my wife. That's me underneath the mask.''',

Hitchcock: Well, I'm sorry, but I refuse to mask my natural musk with a bunch of chemicals.''',

Gina: Apparently not. I am, of course, exotic silk, where you, sir, are snake skin.''',
          '''Rosa: I bet she tucked herself into bed too tight and got stuck.''',
          '''Jake: I promise I will be stone-cold serious in my interview. I'll even use my serious face. If you're wondering how I'm pulling this off, I'm thinking about the time when I was eight and Don Mattingly called me a little turd.
Captain Holt: Was he right?
Jake: Yes.''',

          '''Jake: Rosa has this dumb rule about not mixing work with personal stuff.
Amy: That's actually not a bad policy. I once gave my aunt a jaywalking ticket and things really deteriorated between us.''',

Rosa: Those are exactly the same.
Jake: I have a signature look, Rosa.''',
          '''Regina Park: Sorry if my voice is raspy. They just took the breathing tube out.
Captain Holt: But they left the BS in?
Sergeant Jeffords: Good God.
Charles: Whoa.''',
          '''Amy: Now, in true Munkensmat, you pile all of your belongings on a raft, push it out to the icy sea, and set fire to it with a flaming arrow. But since we obviously don't have an archer-
Rosa: I'm an archer. I have like six bows in my car.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I'm here because Major Crimes wants this case. I was hoping to tell them you have some leads. I overheard you mention a Bill Bo-Baggins. Should we bring him in?
Jake: Well, as much as I would love to meet him, he is not a suspect.''',
          '''Amy: Oh, nothing better after a long shift than coming to Shaw's. It's like Cheers, where everybody knows your name.
Rosa: A place where everybody knows your name is hell. You're describing hell.''',
          '''Amy: You're really gonna let these firefighters take Shaw's from us? Think of all the celebrations we've had here, all the times Terry has yelled "Nine-Nine!"
Captain Holt: I hate it when he says that. He should say, "Cheers to the Ninety-Ninth Precinct!"''',
          '''Charles: Well, you know who didn't think it was a good run? My daddy, Lynn Boyle. He's inconsolable.
Gina: Well, I'm sure he'll get over it.
Charles: No, Boyles don't "get over it." It becomes part of us. It lives within us. It eats us out.''',
          '''Captain Holt: No, I mean, quitting permanently, I'm putting in my resignation as soon as I get back home. I better hurry if I want to be at the airport six hours ahead of my flight.''',
          '''Jake: Yeah, and your new shirt is very aggressive and confusing. Is the pineapple the slut, or is it calling someone else a slut?
Captain Holt: Clearly the pineapple is the slut.
Jake: Huh.''',
          '''Jake: But I have an idea for a new ring bearer who is very adorable and very obedient.
Charles: I would be-
Jake: I'm talking about Cheddar the dog.
Charles: Yep, right.
Captain Holt: Brilliant. He loves responsibility.''',
          '''Gina: What are we looking for? Can you describe the envelope?
Captain Holt: It was a white number ten. It's the same kind you use to send fan mail to yourself.
Gina: I've never done that, but I do know what envelopes my fans use, so that's very helpful.''',
          '''Rosa: So what do you think?
Amy: Mm, I don't love the sash. But it's fine. I'm just gonna get it.
Rosa: What? That's the first one you tried on. I once saw you look at 54 different accordion folders and not buy any of them due to weak tabs.
Amy: I file hard. I need strong tabs.''',
          '''Captain Holt: [shouting a tweet outloud] "Kudos to our brave officers"!
Sergeant Jeffords: Hey, now.
Gina: Whoa! What is going on?
Captain Holt: It's in all caps.''',
          '''Amy: So, your sister's a bit of a nightmare.
Jake: I wouldn't say that. I mean, at most, she's a daymare.
Amy: Those are so much scarier.
Jake: Yeah.''',
          '''Charles: Jake, piece of advice: just give up. It's the Boyle way. It's why our family crest is a white flag.''',
          '''Charles: Anyway, meet the new recruit I signed up.
Peter: New NutriCruit? Boom, boom!
Jake: Boom, boom. My name is Barry St. Barry. And I can't wait to get inside and unlock my NutriFuture.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Well, hello, Dolly.''',
          '''Jake: That's okay. I have no questions. That's right. I'm about to monologue, son.''',
          '''Kevin: This installation is composed of Constantine's accounts of the first Punic War in the year 264-
Jake: Ah, yes the first pubic war, the sexiest of all wars. Hi, Dr. Albrin Einstibe. I have an urgent question for you about Ancient Greece.''',
          '''Rosa: Yeah, we all have huge problems.
Gina: You kinda look like Phil Spector when he was on trial.''',
          '''Rosa: Why are you so excited? You don't care about those stupid books.
Jake: I actually did read all of them in prison. They are the greatest books I've ever read, and I've read "Cujo."''',
          '''Jake: Terry, you are a great husband, father, detective, painter, dancer, and you're so jacked you have muscles on your back.
Sergeant Jeffords: Everyone has back muscles, Jake.
Jake: Nuh-huh, my back looks like the inside of a spoon.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Boyle, it's us. Where were you going? Why would you leave that windowless supply closet we locked you in? Ah, yes, hearing it, I understand why.''',
          '''Jake: Insult me all you want, for I have only this to say-
Both: Victory shall be mine!
Amy: I heard you practicing in the shower. You can't surprise me. Letting me into your life was the worst mistake you ever made.
Jake: Cool, fun take on our relationship.''',
          '''Jake: The only way we're gonna win is if we team up.
Amy: Good point. I guess my response is ... rot in hell, crap-face! [GASPS] Also, I love you, and I treasure you, and ya bore me.
Jake: God, you're being so mean. Do it more.''',
          '''Jake: Oink, oink. Good morning, sir. Your expression is inscrutable as always.
Captain Holt: And yours is extremely scrutable. You want something. A video game, perhaps? Or a fidget spinner?
Jake: I do want both of those things, but that's not why I'm here.''',
          '''Captain Holt: You got this.
Sergeant Jeffords: You got this.
Charles: You got this.
Jake: Charles, you're-
Charles: In a wheelchair, yep. My back gave out when I was dyeing my pubes. I was only halfway done. I'm like Cruella de Vil down there.''',
          '''Gina: Charles, you know I legally can't answer. Do you want me to have my baby in jail?
Charles: All right, no more questions. Only statements. You are glowing. Brother to sister, you've never looked sexier.
Sergeant Jeffords: Come on, man.''',
          '''Amy: The only celebrity I've ever seen in real life was Paul Shaffer. It was exhilarating.''',
          '''Jake: This is amazing. Spending time with your mother in your childhood home. Ah, the adorable baby pictures, the embarrassing stories. The Founding Fathers Underoos.
Captain Holt: There will be no Underoos.
Jake: You went commando?
Captain Holt: That's enough.''',
          '''Charles: No, that's the Boyle family sourdough starter. It's fed us for 140 years. The bread it births is succulent and firm. Tang for days.
Gina: I hate so many of the words you just used.''',
          '''Jake: Hey, going pretty good, right?
Charles: Hell, yes. It's like a Bonnie Raitt concert in here.
Jake: No.''',
          '''Jake: Mm, hey, Captain.
Captain Holt: Are you just waking up? It's 11:00 a.m.
Jake: [scoffs] No, no, I'm just tired 'cause, um, I worked out so much this morning.
Captain Holt: Ah.
Jake: You know, squat 400 on the bench push fitness and whatnot.''',
          '''Jake: Right, right. Um, I know that Terry definitely did do that work, so I'll just go grab 'em. Okay. Uh, you wait here. You can't come in because Amy's naked and she's embarrassed of her weird body.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Oh, I see what's happening here. Uh, due to an issue with the Internet cloud, you are seeing a series of pictures that have nothing to do with me or the 99th precinct.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: I'm sorry for interrupting your dinner party.
Captain Holt: No problem at all. This is important. Also, Kevin's friend Margo is here, and she's a real class-A drip.''',
          '''Margo: Oh, Ray, there you are. I'm about to start my Scottsdale slideshow. It has all the highlights.
Captain Holt: There are no highlights in Scottsdale, Margo.
Margo: That's what you think, Raymond.
Captain Holt: [breathing deeply]''',
          '''Captain Holt: Kind of seemed like you were gonna get up and leave after saying all that.
Sergeant Jeffords: I was, but I think I hear Margo.''',
          '''Captain Holt: When people say, "Good morning," they mean, "Hello." When people say, "How are you?" they mean, "Hello." When people say, "What's up?" they mean, "I am a person not worth talking to."''',
          '''Gina: We've been going for a while you feeling hungry?
Sergeant Jeffords: Starving, thanks. [Gina throws the yogurt against the wall] Oh, come on!
Gina: You get a yogurt when I get the truth.
Amy: Oh God, it's in the grout. It's gonna smell in here forever.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Grand theft auto. Grand theft auto. Grand theft auto. Dog fraud.
Doug Judy: I sold a guy a fake Pekinese. 'Twas a cat.
Captain Holt: You will not win me over with your use of "'twas.
Doug Judy: 'Twasn't trying to.
Jake: (SNORTS)''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Jake, look. You think it's our guys?
Jake: Maybe. But this is New York, so there's a very strong chance it's just "city blood."''',
          '''Jake: Hey there, Nikolaj, my man. How you doing?
Nikolaj Boyle: Hi, Jake, we made Daddy Latvian Christmas cookies. Want one?
Jake: You bet I do.
Genevieve: The potato really brings out the vinegar.
Jake: Neither of those are cookie things. I'm just gonna put that back.''',
          '''Jake: Trust me, it's gonna be fine.
Charles: Really? 'Cause you said that about "Die Hard 5," Jake.
Jake: Oh. It's not gonna be fine.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I assumed you've climbed out of your rat tunnels to taunt us about tonight's charity caroling competition.''',
          '''Jake: So, pretty crazy how you took out that Latvian mob guy back there.
Charles: I know, I felt like a superhero, like the Hulk's mom.
Jake: Why the mom?''',
          '''Jake: Charles, stop scooching.
Charles: I am going to scooch. You don't tell me when to scooch.
Jake: I can't get by. Curse my beautiful bubble butt.''',
          '''Charles: See, all Boyle men are blessed with a flat ass, which is perfect for scooching.''',
          '''Nikolaj Boyle: It's a police man, just like you, Papa. This is the coolest present ever. "I'm Detective Papa, and I'm going to go to the Farmers Market.
I hope they have aged Gouda."''',

Night Shyamalan twist- Oh! [snaps] "Signs"! [Jake and Gina gasp] Wait, do you think he's behind all of this?
Jake: I do not.''',
          '''Rosa: What do you have in there?
Captain Holt: A balloon arch.
Rosa: Oh, my God, Captain. She is magnificent.
Captain Holt: Vindication!''',
          '''Gina: My point is, I can do anything Charles can.
Jake: Except look exactly like the body double I got for him. Bill, you can come out now.
Bill: Hi.
Gina: Okay, yeah, this pasty white guy is gonna be a problem.''',
          '''Rosa: I got rifles, vests, flash grenades-
Scully: Chips, dips, ice cream sammies-
Amy: I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully.
Scully: Pretty sure? Do you arrest someone if you're pretty sure they're guilty? No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: He's crashing! Push 10 ccs of corticosteroids, plus prep an ER for surgical decompression! Look, I don't know what any of this means, but I feel like Sandra Oh.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I'd like to propose a toast. Even when Bob held that gun to my head, I was not afraid, because I knew you were on the case. I respect the hell out of each and every one of you. Nine-Nine.''',
          '''Rosa: Time for waiting is over. Now is the time for groin-stomping.
Bob Annderson: Damn right, it is! Let's go arrest that punk.
Jake: He says "punk" just like you.
Captain Holt: Where do you think he learned it, punk?''',
          '''Marge: And you, Santiago, maybe the world would like to see that draft of a memo you wrote where you used T-H-E-I-R instead of T-H-E-R-E?
Amy: Oh, you sick son of a bitch.''',
          '''Jake: Hey, Gina! We got an anonymous gift basket. Yeah, it's full of treats. It's got meats, cheeses, candies, all the food groups.''',
          '''Gina: Hmm, what's this, then? "Dear Captain Raymond Holt, thinking of you. Best, Dr.
Kevin Cozner, Ph.D." He even used their pet names.''',
          '''Amy: Look, it's okay. We all have fears. I'm so claustrophobic, I can't even go into the downstairs supply closet. I hear they have some hot new binder clips, but I'll never know.''',
          '''Captain Holt: You're an incredibly gracious host, Mr. Weichselbraun.
Mr. Weichselbraun: Wow, that pronunciation is flawless.
Captain Holt: [laughs] I must admit, I'm a bit of a Weichselbrauniac.''',

Mr. Weichselbraun: You were escorted out for gasping too loudly.''',
          '''Jake: Oh, you sweaty, chair-spinning morons. You're gonna get us out of here.''',
          '''Captain Holt: All right, everyone, enough morning chitchat. Television happened, commutes were difficult, Boyle had a dream.''',

Rosa: Juice Ellen! Juice Ellen!
Amy: Fraud dog!''',
          '''Captain Holt: This just might work out after all.
Gina: You're damn right it will, 'cause we're a ragtag, scrappity, fart-dumb, moron parade, smart-ass team!''',
          '''Amy: Cruise itineraries, hot out of the laminator. Who's ready for some nonstop totally scheduled fun?''',
          '''Captain Holt: I need this to settle my nerves. Hurricane Debbie is approaching. My little sister Debbie, she's a real drama queen.
Gina: The drama queen of the Holt family. What, did she laugh out loud one time?
Captain Holt: She's laughed out loud multiple times.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Perfect timing as our quarantine has finally ended and our goiters are gone.
Jake: Yes, indeed. We're free to go outside and lick whoever's eyeballs we'd like.
Captain Holt: Inaccurate, no one is ever free to do that.
Jake: Yeah, you're right.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Dancing over. Situation defused.
Jake: No!''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Jake, can I speak to you for a minute? In private.
Jake: Ooh, someone's in trouble. It's me. I don't know why I did that.''',
          '''Jake: Okay, wait, you can't talk to her! Terry doesn't want you in there. You make her uncomfortable.
Captain Holt: I make her uncomfortable? Well, that's ridiculous. I should go confront her about this at length.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: I'm sorry I got angry earlier. You did a great job today. Hospital was the right decision. I'm so glad you're Ava's godfather. I'm so glad you're Sharon's god-husband.
I'm so glad you're my god-wife. I have no idea what I'm saying at this point.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I want you two to go undercover as a couple to stake out the room.
You should be very convincing, given that you're currently what was it? "Smooshing booties."
Jake: Great, and thank you for saying it that way. It made us both feel very comfortable.
Amy: Sure did.''',
          '''Jake: Holy crap.
Captain Holt: No one can know about this, understood?
Jake: Understood.
Gina: Understood. What? I hang out in the men's room all the time. The acoustics are amazing.''',
          '''Jake: So, we broke a rule.
Amy: Yeah. Hope it wasn't a mistake.
Jake: "Hope it wasn't a mistake." Title of your sex tape. Oh! Title of our sex tape!''',
          '''Gina: Captain. I know this isn't my place to say, but Madeline Wuntch is here to see you.

Gina: Ideally, bull fighter, but it's such a boy's club.''',
          '''Amy: Jake, he's a highly decorated detective. He's not gonna be impressed by your sunglass choreography. He's gonna be too distracted by my notebook flip.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Nope.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Sir, Gina's dance concert was last night.
Captain Holt: Right. The Dancy Reagan performance.''',

Gina: Oh, Charles. I can't take that. It's clearly not cash, and I don't have time in my life to return things.''',

Amy: Don't remind me. I'm going to be untangling that web for a month.''',
          '''Jake: Sorry I'm late. I had to go back to the deli and return my Everything Bagel. In what world does everything not include beef jerky?
Rosa: All of them.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Santiago, I may need you to come in for a bit on saturday.
Amy: Again? Are you kidding me, man? (Gasps) I'm sorry. Let's start fresh. Hi!
Sergeant Jeffords: Oh, my God.
Captain Holt: What just happened?
Gina: Her mind finally snapped, like a stale breadstick.''',
          '''Jake: People love it. Look at that, two painted ladies just joined in. You got to admit, Boyle really knows how to move his pelvis.''',
          '''Jake: Amy Santiago is officially late for the first time ever. All right, let's do this. Who's got theories?
Sergeant Jeffords: Uh, alarm didn't go off.
Jake: All three alarms? All with battery back-up? Come on, who wants to take this seriously?''',
          '''Jake: It is fun, but you're all wrong. She clearly slipped through a subway grate and is having terrible sex with a mole man.''',
          '''Jake: I found our Meat Loaf. Wings.
Sergeant Jeffords: The band or the show?
Jake: The food!''',
          '''Amy: Look, I love campaigning and making signs. Lord knows I have enough poster board at home.''',
          '''Jake: But in all seriousness, your honor, I do think she should recuse herself from the trial.
Sophia: Why? You think I might tell everybody in the courtroom that you like to be the little spoon?

Jake: NYPD! Put down the scalpel and step away from my work friend's wiener tubes.''',

Amy: It's a pilgrim's hat.
Captain Holt: Where's the buckle, Santiago?''',
          '''Gina: I'm not gonna help you rob him, Jake. I'm his assistant, and I take that job incredibly seriously.

Gina: Well, how am I supposed to get it into that garbage can?''',
          '''Gina: Being able to read Jake's handwriting is a gift. A useless, useless gift.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Ten thousand sit-ups.
Jake: Okay. Do you have a back up plan in case my hypothetical person can only do 9500? Or three?''',

          '''Jake: We'll have two parties. A fun party down here with us, then an awkward, uncomfortable one in the living room with Holt. He doesn't even have to know about it. Separate parties.
Separate but equal.

Charles: Sorry, buddy.
Sergeant Jeffords: What? I'm the ten!
Charles: Sure you are.''',

Amy: Especially between the sheets!''',

Charles: Because he actually asked her out.''',
          '''Amy: You wanted to see me sirs? I was reading the sergeant's lips through the window. He either said "bring in Santiago next" or something about a San Diego nest.''',
          '''Jake: All right, sir. Let me hit you with a little analogy. Are you familiar with race cars?
Captain Holt: Formula 1 or stock?
Jake: That's already way more than I know about it.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Here are two pictures. One is your locker. The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines. Can you tell which is which?
Jake: That one's the dump.
Captain Holt: They're both your locker.''',

          '''Amy: So did they defuse the bomb?
Jake: Yeah, one of 'em. Oh, you didn't hear? There was a second bomb. Ya butt. Ya butt is da bomb.
Amy: Aww. On our anniversary.''',

          '''Amy: Hey, Mlepnos.
Mlepnos: I don't know you.
Amy: Kay.''',
          '''Gina: More importantly, why are you guys dressed like that? You look like you're on "Empire".
Scully: That's what we were going for. Drip drop.''',
          '''Charles: Well, there's no reason to be defensive, just because you don't have the bone strength of a yogi. We all have our thing. You're a muscler, I'm a boner.''',
          '''Amy: Ugh, there are silver butt prints everywhere. Why did he need to paint his butt? He wears pants.''',
          '''Captain Holt: What are you doing? You brought my husband to a public place?
Jake: He's undercover. We're perverts, see?
Captain Holt: You're not fooling anyone. Kevin's zipper is up, for God's sake.''',

Charles: Oh, and just like that, things got interesting.
Rosa: And just like that, I left.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Let's do this. I can't wait to get on a plane. I used up my miles, and upgraded first class.
Rosa: Damn, Sarge.
Sergeant Jeffords: This is gonna be great. Sipping on a mimosa, snacking on a hummus trio, watching "Bridget Jones's Baby."''',
          '''Jake: It was the "shouldn't've" that finally tipped me off. I've never heard you use a double contraction before.
Captain Holt: And you never will again.''',
          '''Rosa: Hey, Gina just texted me. She said, "Weird, I didn't even realize they were dating. JK, so happy for you bitches."''',

Sergeant Jeffords: One flan?
Rosa: One flan.
Sergeant Jeffords: That's cold.
Amy: Yeah. Cold. I'm so confused.
Both: They shared the flan!''',
          '''Jake: Sorry not sorry. It was just a stupid pencil.
Captain Holt: It was a gift from my deceased father.
Jake: A pencil? Your dad gave pretty bad gifts. Although on the other hand, all my dad ever gave me was abandonment issues, so, potato-tomato.''',
          '''Amy: Maybe it's time to put the creep kit away, Rosa.
Rosa: Wait. Pimento just walked up to a woman.
Sergeant Jeffords: A female woman? Rosa, is it a female woman?''',

Jake: Okay, I'm just gonna move this away from your nose holes.''',

Captain Holt: Workout your legs, Jeffrey. Not your mouth.
Jeffrey Bouche: [chuckles] You are hilarious.''',
          '''Jake: Did you unbutton another button?
Charles: Eyes up here, Jake. So, did you learn anything, or were you just staring at my body the whole time?''',
          '''Charles: And I'm sorry I said you'll never be a dad. You will be, and you can make it happen tonight. Just go to Amy and make sure afterwards that she holds her knees to her chest for at least-
Jake: All right, I think I'm good on this.''',
          '''Bob Annderson: Would you mind getting us some food? I can't fathom eating these candies that Peralta bought us. Chocolate is the devil's carob.
Captain Holt: And carob is Satan's raisin.''',
          '''Charles: We're not going anywhere. The flight is booked, and there's already a huge stand-by line.
Amy: What? We have to get on that plane. Were you stern?
Charles: Amy, you know I wasn't.''',

Bob Annderson: What shall I tell him?
Captain Holt: "Regards."''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: We have to call for backup.
Bob Annderson: Figgis has people in the NYPD and the FBI. So good luck with that.
Captain Holt: Wow, betraying the FBI is one thing, but sarcasm, Bob? Wow.''',

Building Manager: 410 is Emily Goldfinch.
Amy: Who?
Building Manager: Curly black hair, always smiling, a little chatty for my taste.
Amy: I have so many questions, but there's no time.''',
          '''Jake: Okay, look, this was maybe a weird way to start the night, but the good news is, we can still make our dinner reservation and no one got hurt.
Hitchcock: Actually, I cut myself real bad.
Jake: Of course you did.''',

Amy: Oh, cool. I want a fast sports car.
Jake: Come on. You can be honest.
Amy: I want old, expensive books. I'll send you a list.
Jake: There you go.''',
          '''Jake: Bonjour, Captain. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
Captain Holt: No, I don't want to sleep with you.
Jake: Is that what that means? Oh, man, I had a really gross tennis instructor.''',
          '''Charles: Yeah, now, this Turkmenistani dish is traditionally made from an animal that's been so overfed it can no longer stand.
Scully: Whoo. That's the dream.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Don't worry, sir, we will be cordial A.F. "As Frasier." Love that show.''',

Hitchcock: Should we do it again next week, sir?
Captain Holt: No. I would hate that.''',
          '''Gina: Captain, the commissioner called again. He wants to know when crime will be down.
Captain Holt: Are you kidding me? What am I supposed to tell him? I'm under so much pressure. I just can't even.''',

Jake: Noice. Smort. I love you too.''',
          '''Jake: - Morning, Captain.
Captain Holt: Peralta.
Jake: I'd like to introduce you to someone. His name is Simon, and I hate him.
Captain Holt: Hello, Simon. This is Balthazar. He's an evil demon who spits fire in my throat.
Jake: Goiters, huh?''',
          '''Jake: Charles, did you call this into dispatch?
Charles: Yes, but I can't get in touch with anyone from the Nine-Nine.

Gina: I'm so happy for you and I never want to see your daughter or remember this day.''',

Gina: You're very intense about vents.
Charles: Yeah.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Are you insane? We were just suspended for screwing up this case. I shouldn't even be talking to you. Wuntch can probably hear us right now. She has super sonar hearing, because she's a bat.''',

Captain Holt: Not necessary.''',

Jake: Rosa's wearing pink! Rosa's wearing pink!
Amy: Are we sure it's not just a white shirt that's been bloodied in a motorcycle crash?''',
          '''Captain Holt: Mr. Shaw, let's just cut to the chase. Never's not just a crater on Mars.

Of course, it is a crater on Mars.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Marcus, Detective Diaz, what a surprise. I didn't expect you for another nine and a half minutes.

Gina: You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Jake: No, ch-it.''',

Gina: I said OMG? That was before other people started saying it. I was an originator.''',

Amy: It's horrible.
Rosa: All smiling is horrible. This is worse.''',
          '''Agent Kendrick: What are your demands?
Jake: A guarantee that this drill doesn't end until one of us is dead.
Charles: Also, one large pizza with fennel sausage - brick oven, otherwise it's sog city. And Scully needs some Gasinex, extra strength.
Scully: Chewable!''',
          '''Scully: I really need that Gasinex. I think there was some dairy in the cheesecake that I ate for breakfast.''',
          '''Gina: Move over please, I do have a wedding to plan. Because if this thing's happening, it's not going to be a Boyle Bros event. For starters, all the bridesmaids are going to be dressed like Roseanne from the television show Roseanne.

          '''Jake: Amy, you gotta be glad Holt's here, right? I mean, you're basically in love with him.''',

          '''Gina: I can't believe this is one of the last things I'm ever gonna see.
Rosa: Actually, with Anthrax the last things you'll see will be doctor, blood, doctor, pus, scab, nothing.''',

Captain Holt: No. In fact, I had them wash it.

Amy: Killed a bunch of stray dogs.
Jake: Name's funnier than the story.''',

Rosa: Almost never?
Charles: All the time.''',
          '''Jake: Good news, sergeant. I figured out what we're gonna work on this weekend.
Sergeant Jeffords: I'm working on spending time with my family. We're having a fancy tea party. I am the king of Origami napkins.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: That case almost killed us.
Jake: But I'm on a hot streak. Plus, we're better detectives now. We're smarter. Computers are faster. No more Blockbuster. Drones. I'm feeling it.''',

Go team!''',

Jake: Okay, first of all, your insinuating voice is way too high. It's creepy.

Champagne.
Mountain range.

Scully: Okay, Sarge.
Sergeant Jeffords: Come on, man.''',

Gina: Sexy, but not like we're trying too hard. Like, sure, we're trying, but it's almost effortless.''',

Amy: Amen.
Jake: There isn't?!''',

Sorry I said bitches, I'm just really worked up.''',
          '''The Vulture: I mean, what was it with Diaz's last "impossible" extortion case? What was it? Six hours?
Rosa: That's because it was 98% solved.
The Vulture: The last 2%'s the hardest to get. That's why they leave it in the milk.
Jake: What?''',
          '''Amy: You can't give up control. You're terrible at taking your primary's orders. You just do whatever you want. I could go on and on and on.
Jake: Is something no lover of yours has ever said.''',
          '''Amy: Hey, sergeant, you know how you're really good at doodling?
Sergeant Jeffords: I know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult. You a big fan of Picasso's doodles?''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Let's start with the eyes. Were they desperate, lonely? Did they betray heartache?
Victim: They were brown.

Gina: That's true in all cases. Cops are the worst.''',

Amy: Yes. I can only imagine.''',

Jake: We are very close, Captain, aside from a complete absence of evidence, suspects, or leads. So in conclusion, not at all close.''',

Jake: The Deputy Commissioner threw my report in Terry's trash can, and he'd been eating yoghurt earlier.
Captain Holt: Terry loves yoghurt.''',

          '''Rosa: Gina, enough. Boyle needed the bathroom so we told him about it. Just like I told you when you needed it. Leave him alone. He saved my life. Plus, he's pitiful and his life is crap right now.
Charles: Yeah, it is. Thank you, Rosa.''',
          '''Jake: I have not slept in since I last saw you many hours. Plus, I think I'm hallucinating, because your I'm pretty sure I just heard your biceps mocking me.
Sergeant Jeffords: No, that's possible. My biceps mock a lot of people.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Go back inside!
Gina: Are you talking to us or the farts?''',
          '''Jake: You know when you play along with the robot jokes, it kinda ruins my enjoyment of them?
Captain Holt: Yes, I know.''',
          '''Jake: I found this, by the way. You wrote Mr. Charles Ludley over a thousand times. Why would you take her last name, Boyle?''',
          '''Gina: Okay, here's what I found out about our competition. Brian Jensen, born 1899, served in the Navy during World War One. A hero at the battle of Scimitar Hill, Jensen perished in a factory fire in the Netherlands. This may be a different Brian Jensen.''',
          '''Jake: In fact, I will guarantee you that by the end of the night, Kev and I will be best friends.
Captain Holt: He hates being called Kev.
Jake: Or does he?
Captain Holt: Yes.''',
          '''Amy: Hummus, thoughts?
Captain Holt: I have no thoughts about hummus.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Santiago, are you hiding in my bathroom with a dog you're deathly allergic to?
Amy: No.''',
          '''Jake: Fire Marshall Boone, we meet again.
Boone: Detective Peralta. Your fly's down. I made you look.
Jake: I didn't look and I'm wearing shorts. There is no fly.
Boone: That's not what your mom said.
Jake: You make no sense.
Boone: And now I'm inside your head.''',
          '''Amy: Your stake-out bag is ninety-percent nuts.
Jake: I get snacky. Besides, nuts are super healthy. They're like 0% fat.
Amy: Jake, that's not true at all. It's actually the opposite.
Jake: What? That nut vendor lied to me!''',
          '''Captain Holt: Hand me the small dogs, Santiago.''',
          '''Amy: How long can you possibly hide in here?
Gina: I sent all the captain's calls here. My phone battery's at 100% charge. And I have ten loose diner mints in my purse. This is my home now.''',
          '''Jake: Woah, woah, woah. Where are you going, Cold Mountain? I changed your codename.
Captain Holt: To use the restroom.
Jake: I'm only asking this for your safety. Is it a number one or a number two?
Your silence indicates number two.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Everything's spoiled. My lunch is ruined. My chicken, my potatoes, pasta, my meatballs, ham, my yogurt.
Charles: Wow, that's a lot of yogurt.
Sergeant Jeffords: I love yogurt.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I know everyone's mad at Peralta for ruining their weekend.
Jake: But?
Captain Holt: That was it. I was just demonstrating for Detective Peralta what a fact is.''',
          '''Jake: I can't believe you live nearby, and you won't let anyone crash at your place.
Rosa: You people already know too much about me.
Jake: I know exactly three facts about you, and one of them is that you won't let any of us crash at your place.''',
          '''Jake: This gambit was designed to fail. It's just like in chess. Sometimes in order to win, you've got to sacrifice your king.
Captain Holt: That's exactly how you lose at chess. Have you ever played the game?''',
          '''Charles: What if we wrap his motorcycle in plastic wrap and melt it with a hair dryer? Little trick I learned in gift basket making class.''',
          '''Jake: From this point on, I'll do every part of the job perfectly. Perfecter than perfectly.
Captain Holt: It's more perfect. You said that imperfectly.
Jake: I was testing you. You did perfectly.''',
          '''Gina: How many times have I smacked you in your face?
Charles: Lost count.
Gina: And you still have no fear of me.
Charles: I'm trying to read your womb vibe.
Gina: Exactly. Knock it off.''',
          '''Amy: We're going to secretly record the Vulture telling you to dump me. Then we'll play it for Chief Garmin, and then-
Jake: We're gonna totally have sex on top of each other.
Amy: You get to keep your job.
Jake: Yes, that.''',
          '''Scully: Oh, I could take that shift.
Captain Holt: The last time you worked a Saturday you watched cartoons the entire time.
Scully: Well that's when they're on.''',
          '''Gina: And just to clarify, just how untethered is vacation Terry from his wife?
Sergeant Jeffords: Very tethered.''',
          '''Jake: So how'd you convince the whole squad to betray me? What'd you offer them?
Captain Holt: I asked them if they wanted to embarrass you, and they instantly said yes.
Jake: I'm not gonna lie, that turns me on a little bit.''',
          '''Scully: I didn't even notice he was wearing a cape.
Amy: You're a cop. You should have realized that.''',
          '''Scully: I met my wife at an orgy. Well, she was leaving an orgy, and we bumped into each other on the street. Real meet cute.''',
          '''Captain Holt: My husband's dog, Cheddar, had relations with my neighbor's dog, Karate, and produced these two smaller dogs. He insisted I find them a good home with someone we trust.''',
          '''Amy: You look happy. Let me guess. Your egg sandwich fell on the floor, and they gave it to you for free.
Jake: No. Can you do that? Why doesn't everyone just drop their sandwiches on the floor?
Amy: I was trying to insult you.
Jake: And instead you gave me an amazing life hack!''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Look, Jake, I love you like you're one of my daughters.
Jake: Really?''',
          '''Jake: You know the medical examiner? I kind of had sex with her last night.
Amy: What?
Jake: Oh, sorry, I forgot who I was talking to. Sex is something that two adults do with their bodies when they're attracted to each other.
Rosa: He's right, Santiago, did you not know that?''',
          '''Rosa: No, Robo-Cop. It's got everything I like. Gratuitous violence.
Jake: Oh, I thought you were listing things.
Rosa: I was. I'm done.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Police approval ratings are - pardon my language - in the commode.''',
          '''Rosa: She also likes to look up recipes online and go, "Who's got the time?"''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: I can't wait. This weekend, I am Vacation Terry. No kids. No responsibilities. I'm just a balloon floating in the great blue sky and I am untethered.''',
          '''Rosa: You brought pineapple?
Sergeant Jeffords: Well, the fanny runs deep. I am prepared for any vacation situation. I've got a bottle opener, sun screen, inflatable neck pillow. Wait, are we having fondue?''',
          '''Rosa: I'm out. Four hours is the most time I've ever spent alone with any human. It was the worst experience of my life.
Amy: What about that time we drove up to Boston together. That was about four hours. Oh, I see what just happened.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Now let's go look for bad kids who went to sub-par pre-schools.''',
          '''Jake: Okay, don't shoot! That's how people get shot.''',
          '''Jake: Almost makes me wanna take things seriously all the time. But then I'm like "boobs, farts, boobs, whatever".''',
          '''Gina: Jake, he is a sea-witch in disguise, do not sing into his shell.''',
          '''Charles: And then, a skywriter's gonnna write Charles loves V. I couldn't afford her full name.
Jake: First of all, Charles loves V means something very specific, and I'm gonna guess not what you're intending. More importantly, you're going Full Boyle.''',
          '''Jake: Uh, actually, someone reported they couldn't find your head. But we found it, it was up your butt. You're a fire man, you should know how to treat that burn.''',
          '''Scully: I found my gun. It was in my holster. My holster's on my butt.''',
          '''Rosa: Is that a nightgown?
Sergeant Jeffords: That's mine. It's a T-shirt from my fat phase.
Jake: "If at first you don't secede, try try again."
Sergeant Jeffords: You're that big, you buy anything that fits. A lot of fat guy clothes have racist overtones.''',
          '''Jake: That's how we do it in the Nine-Nine, sir. Catch bad guys and look good doing it.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Good news is our evaluation will be done by Deputy Chief Brandt. We have a good rapport. He was once my captain.
Charles: So he's kinda like our grand-captain?
Captain Holt: That is amazingly funny.''',
          '''Rosa: I'll be back. Don't move.
Scully: Not a problem. I hate moving.''',
          '''Amy: He heard that I speak Spanish, and he made me fire his housekeeper. She was Polish.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I know you'd all rather be at home binge-watching media content.
Jake: Oh, I just started the second season of Media Content. No spoilers!''',
          '''Captain Holt: Boyle, where is everyone?
Charles: Hiding from me in the evidence room. They think I don't know, but Gina's been live tweeting the whole thing.
Captain Holt: She live tweets everything. Ruined Downton Abbey for me.''',
          '''Captain Holt: You're all hiding from Boyle!
Hitchock: Not me, Captain. I was napping.
Captain Holt: That's worse!''',
          '''Rosa: We work in a police force full of dudes. We got to have each other's backs, okay?
Amy: You're saying you have my back?
Rosa: Yeah, I got your back. Don't smile. I'm still mad at you.
Amy: I thought we were having a moment.
Rosa: Moment's over. Shut up.''',
          '''Amy: We got egged. Some of shell got in my contacts, and my hair, and my mouth, and my bra.
Jake: Can't tell if that's hot or not.
Amy: Not hot. Egg shell in my bra is not hot.
Jake: Well, it's kinda hot. Boobs go in a bra.''',
          '''Rosa: Can't tell you how many nuns I wanted to beat up in Catholic school. Ten.
Sergeant Jeffords: I didn't know you went to Catholic school.
Rosa: Good. You shouldn't know it.''',
          '''Jake: Give me your hair dryer.
Rosa: What?
Amy: What are you talking about?
Jake: Don't you carry one in your purse?
Amy: Have you ever met a human woman?''',
          '''Captain Holt: First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping. But more importantly, detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously?''',
          '''Charles: He is so strong but so gentle. He's like an enormous, muscular Ellen DeGeneres.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Climbing the side of the building with a blowtorch? What were you thinking?
Jake: I was thinking I had better core strength. I got winded like ten feet up.''',
          '''Gina: Hey, Charles, you pretty excited about Jake being back?

Charles: Yeah, it's like when I was a kid and my grandma came home from the hospital, only better because Jake's not unresponsive.
Gina: Every time you talk I hear that sound that plays when Pacman dies.''',
          '''Captain Holt: How many cars would you say this Pontiac Bandit has stolen?
Jake: 230 that I know of, but the real number could be in the millions.
Captain Holt: You're not very good at math.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Santiago, when I greet the deputy chief, I want you there by my side to make a good impression. No offense, but you are something of a teacher's pet.
Amy: None taken. People love their pets.''',
          '''Charles: Oh, my God, he's beautiful. Oh, Jake, he's got your face.
Amy: Charles, meet Mac.
Jake: Short for McClane.
Charles: As in Shirley? I love it.
Jake: No, as in John, from "Die Hard."
Charles: I mean, they're both incredibly cool. Only one Oscar winner.''',
          '''Charles: Bone broth! It's an old Boyle family recipe. I drink it after every workout, and I'm never sore.
Sergeant Jeffords: Boyle, I don't think we're maxing out at the same weight at the gym.
Charles: Oh, Terry, they're just numbers. You'll get there.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Charles, this Boyle bone broth is incredible. I'm not sore at all anymore.
Charles: I told you it works. The Boyles used to drink it during potato digging season to keep everyone healthy in the furrows.''',
          '''Captain Holt: So now I know who the sumbitch is who took my dog. The only problem is, I have no idea where to find that sumbitch.
Kevin: Well, Raymond, I think we can help you find that sumbitch. Jake?
Jake: Sumbitch. We all got to say it.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Okay, if we're gonna pull this off, we need to teach you how to move, talk, and act exactly like Kevin.
Kevin: In other words we have a "Pygmalion" situation.
Jake: Exactly, a "pig mailman" situation.''',
          '''Charles: Why would you do that? Jake and Holt are like the '92 dream team.
Amy: I know you're not talking about sports, so who do you think the '92 Dream Team was?
Charles: Aladdin and Abu.
Amy: Right.''',
          '''Amy: This is clearly the work of Charles Boyle, the son of a florist.
Charles: You think I'd make bouquets that look like this? With all this baby's-breath? What do you think of me?''',
          '''Captain Holt: Okay. Give me your flute. Wrong! First rule: never give anyone your flute.''',
          '''Charles: Ooh, fun! Terry's playing the flute.
Captain Holt: At work. Who are you, William Wonka?''',
          '''Jake: I can't believe you hit me. I'm sorry. My face is throbbing. Hey, "Dino Bites."''',
          '''Jake: Fair point, but we do shatter a lot of glass around here. Either it's Rosa who's disappointed in her Buzzfeed results...
[flashback to Rosa on a computer:]
Rosa: I am not a Blanche! [throws the mouse through a window]''',
          '''Jake: Charles, no. Look. You have to take the task force job.
Charles: Really? What about Nikolaj?
Jake: He's gonna be so proud of his dad. I bet he even ditches those new friends.
Charles: Oh, man. That's the dream.''',
          '''Charles: I shouldn't have pushed for the fish ball machine. I should've just played it safe and gone for the fish cake machine.
Amy: So you don't think the fish part was the problem?
Charles: I don't.''',
          '''Jake: Wait, Wuntch is dead?
Sergeant Jeffords: Yeah. The Commissioner's office just notified us.
Captain Holt: No way that's true. As Wuntch says when she sees deodorant, "I'm not buying it."
Rosa: [laughs]''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Sir, she's dead.
Captain Holt: Oh, Terry. Zombies can't die. This is some sort of scam. If she were dead, we would be hearing the sounds of children singing in the streets.''',
          '''Rosa: Oh, you must be feeling better. You're heating up your favorite meal; beans.
Captain Holt: They're refried. It's bad enough they were cooked once, let alone twice, and now the toaster oven makes it three times. I couldn't be crying for help any louder.''',
          '''Rosa: All you have to do is say a few nice comments during the memorial.
Captain Holt: As God said when Wuntch tried to sneak past the gates into heaven, "It ain't happening, honey."
Rosa: [cackles]''',
          '''Hitchcock: Oh, come on. It's like every woman in this city has all of her teeth. Stupid Bloomberg and his stupid soda ban!''',
          '''Captain Holt: Lieutenant, as you know, I've been walking the same beat for the past three weeks. It's become a bit tedious.
Sergeant Jeffords: I thought you loved tedium.
Captain Holt: I love monotony. They're very different.''',
          '''Captain Holt: But we have to let the investigation run its course. Right now, everyone's a suspect.
Rosa: Except for Hitchcock and Scully. Whoever did it took the stairs.''',
          '''Hitchcock: It was her. I heard her setting up a drop.
Jake: And why were you in the women's room?
Hitchcock: It wasn't for a gross reason. The men's room was occupied, and I had to dump out.
Jake: Well, as long as it wasn't for a gross reason.''',
          '''Jake: Okay so the women's gym and the cocaine have given Debbie super powers. Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Don't call her Santiago, call her Virginia Slim. Because I'm smoking her.
Sergeant Jeffords: Damn, Ray!''',
          '''Captain Holt: So, Diaz, I've never been more excited. My first time playing the Jimmy Jabs, and I'm destined to win. Look at my competition. Little Miss Hay For Brains. The Hay Brains, and King Brain Made of Hay.''',
          '''Charles: Okay, here we go, everyone. The game begins when the elevator doors ding. Are you ready for the Hellevator?
Hitchcock: Buckle up. The juice is loose! I am, Hitchcock!
Jake: What the [bleep]?''',
          '''Charles: "Extra ranch, no tomato, no cilantro." These are just a list of modifications on a signature salad from Panera.
Jake: Okay, this one says, "Buy toilet paper" in a truly gigantic font. I hate to think of the horrific event that led to a reminder of this size.''',
          '''Hitchcock: I dogsat for Scully, and he never thanked me. Kelly was a real handful.
Sergeant Jeffords: Wait, I'm confused again. Kelly was a dog?
Scully: There were two Kellys. You'd know that if you'd ever listened to my podcast.''',
          '''Amy: Sir, it's a seminar that's too boring for me. I'm saying no to a seminar.''',
          '''Captain Holt: [over radio] The service road a quarter mile away is also clear. Hold on. There's a pigeon approaching. Hold the mission. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo.
Jake: Great work with that pidge, officer.''',
          '''Captain Holt: It's like there's something great at this party for everyone, even me. She's serving my favorite dessert: carrots.''',
          '''Jake: Okay, we've got her meeting the mayor, her dog-sitting for Bo Obama, Malala giving her an award, but no photos of Wuntch.
Captain Holt: That's because vampires don't appear on film. Perhaps we should be looking for a 17th-century woodblock print.''',
          '''Captain Julie Kim: [o.s.] Hello?
Captain Holt: She's coming. Hide.
Jake: Title of your sex tape? In here.''',

          '''Jake: You know what, screw this. We need a break. I'm a cop, I can protect us. We're going to the library. These two oranges are stepping out. Oh, damn it, peeling out. It was right there!''',
          '''Jake: Moving on, we're going to need disguises. And since we're going to a public library, the best way to fit in is as-
Kevin: Scholars.
Jake: Weird perverts.
Kevin: Yes, weird perverts is far better.
Jake: Far better.''',
          '''Amy: No offense, Scully, but you can't be good or bad at jigsaw puzzles. It's just putting shapes together. There's no strategy or reasoning, or logic-
Scully: Look, I got half a page!
Amy: He is the one.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Enough. We have to get back to the safe house immediately. Let's go. And if you're gonna be a pervert, Kevin, adjust yourself as you walk. Move some quarters around in your pocket.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Seamus Murphy.
Seamus Murphy: That's right. Remember how I saved your detectives from prison in exchange for a favor? The time has come-
Captain Holt: Wait. This isn't my order.
Seamus Murphy: What?
Captain Holt: This is an omelet. I only eat omelets on vacation.''',
          '''Jake: Yes, it's in the impound lot! My brain baby's a genius. It's a miracle.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Pumping hard or hardly pumping, Gina?''',
          '''Captain Holt: Did he say what he would do to him?
Jake: No, they ran over a huge pothole and then complained about de Blasio for the next hour.
Captain Holt: Yes, he needs to do something about the roads.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Anything else?
Rosa: Uh, yes. Something I'd like to say. I'm a pretty private person so this is kinda hard for me, but here we go. I'm bisexual. All right. I will now field one minute and zero seconds of questions pertaining to this. Go.''',
          '''Gina: Ehh, you know, in another lifetime, you and I would've made a hot ass couple.
Rosa: Agreed.''',
          '''Jake: Oh, GPS says turn left here. Turn left.
Captain Holt: No, this route is more direct.
Jake: Oh, okay. You do you, Commish.
Captain Holt: Please don't call me that.
Jake: Okay, fine, I'll just call you the 'Mish no wait, Mishy Elliot - no wait, Mish-es Doubtfire.''',
          '''Scully: Oh, I'd like to see an increase in vacation days.
Hitchcock: And we should all get summers off like teachers. Let the city go to purge.''',
          '''Rosa: Also, now we go back to never talking about my love life again.
Charles: Uh, request denied. Is her name Anne? Meredith? Kim? Erica? Moana?''',
          '''Charles: So, who do you got your eye on?
Rosa: What?
Charles: You haven't dated anyone since you broke up with Pimento. And funerals are a meat market. Sadness is a powerful aphrodisiac.
Rosa: No, it's not.
Charles: Then how come everyone cries during sex?''',
          '''Charles: Don't worry, I got this. Nobody sucks up like a Boyle. Our scoliosis allows us to bow more deeply than normal people.''',
          '''Charles: My cousin Torvald is a hemophiliac, and his wife is a leech farmer. I say "wife," but it's a common-law marriage. For the longest time, Boyle wedding ceremonies were not recognized in the state.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
Kevin: [sighs] Because I love our annual trips to Saratoga Springs. The two of us driving in silence, looking at the barren trees. It's perfect. I I didn't wanna lose that.''',

Scully: What the? [catches d-hole in his mouth] It's finally happening!''',
          '''Jake: Attention, Nine-Nine. We have an announcement.
Charles: "Shrek Live" is coming back to Broadway!
Jake: Nope, you dreamed that.
Charles: Aw.''',
          '''Jake: Wait, what's wrong? Something's wrong. That's the look my mom gave me right before she told me that my dad left. Oh, God, did my dad leave my mom again? How do you know my mom and dad?''',
          '''Charles: Why do we even have police horses anymore? We have motorcycles now. They're faster, cooler. They also don't get boners in the background of every photo of you and the mayor.''',
          '''Jake: Nothing makes sense anymore. The Vulture's not the Vulture, good is bad, up is down, there's a young pope, winter has come. That reminds me: I ordered some premium cable channels.''',
          '''Rosa: You okay?
Charles: Yeah, no burns. The doctor said I was lucky my body was so damp.''',
          '''Charles: No, look. Daily News got it right. Yeah."Hero Cop Saves Helpless Buffoon." Oh, no. Am I the buffoon?''',
          '''Charles: Whoa, all this is for me?
Rosa: Yep. You saved Peanut Butter, even though he's a dick.
Charles: He is a dick.''',
          '''Jake: Captain, allow me to introduce you to major East Coast arms dealer Dan "Daniel" Valdano. That's right, his nickname is longer than his actual name. Why's that, Terry?
Sergeant Jeffords: 'Cause he's a dick.''',
          '''Jake: Captain, do I have a tell?
Captain Holt: No, you don't understand the game well enough to have a tell.
Jake: Yeah, that makes sense.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I can stop whenever I want.
Sergeant Jeffords: Then stop.
Captain Holt: I don't want.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Hot damn! Four queens. I call this hand the Golden Girls.''',
          '''Amy: Hey, standing desk. Look who's taking care of herself. Someone's not sitting down on the job.
Rosa: Hey. Sitting down on the job is damned hard work, and those heroes prove it every day. Mad respect.''',
          '''Rosa: Seriously, you guys should stand up once in a while. You know, for your hearts.''',
          '''Captain Holt: So, where on Gina's mobile should I place this moonless Jupiter? I pity the child who lies beneath this solar system.''',
          '''Hitchcock: Hey, Captain, something's going on with this heist. You tell us everything you know, and we'll tell you everything we know.
Captain Holt: I'd rather not.
Scully: [CHUCKLES] Jokes on you, we don't know anything.
Captain Holt: Well, good day then.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I know one of you took Cheddar, and you did it for the sake of the heist, but if anything happens to him, I will end you. I couldn't bring myself to neuter Cheddar, but I will neuter you all.''',
          '''Captain Holt: And no one won the heist.
All: Captain!
Jake: Get over it, ya jag!
Amy: Yeah, ya jag!''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: It was eight weeks.
Rosa: I also went to prison, dog.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Well, I for one think you're perfect for each other-
Jake: Feel like there's gonna be more.
Captain Holt: Because you're both losers.
Jake: There it is.''',
          '''Captain Holt: None of you stand a chance against me. No courage, no patience, no brains, and, of course, a bald old man.
Sergeant Jeffords: I'm younger than you.
Captain Holt: No comeback for the bald thing, I see.''',
          '''Jake: They fell for it.
Charles: Hook, line, and sphincter.
Jake: It's sinker.
Charles: No, it's sphincter. That's where you put the hook in when you're eeling.
Jake: Well, I never use that expression again.''',
          '''Jake: Will you please help me get out of this? It's not for the heist. I just really have to pee.
Amy: I know you don't drink water. You pee once every two days. And you went this morning.
Jake: Damn it, you know me so well.''',
          '''Rosa: So, what should I do?
Amy: Maybe don't jump to conclusions.
Sergeant Jeffords: No! Interrogate him! Follow the flan, Rosa. Follow the flan.
Rosa: Right. Follow the flan.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Could we put a mirroring app on her phone so we could watch everything she does?
Hitchcock: Oh, those work great, but you have to physically have her phone to install it.
Captain Holt: Nobody ask Hitchcock why he knows that.''',
          '''Amy: Maybe you could just imagine doing that. It'd be probably just as fun as actually doing it, right?
Rosa: No.
Captain Holt: I'm with Diaz. Imagination is never the solution.''',
          '''Amy: Captain Holt, can you distract the lot attendant?
Captain Holt: I'm not Captain Holt. I'm Joe Wozniak, here to see my girl in prison. And, to help me pass as a straight Kevin's rose-shearing hat.''',
          '''Captain Holt: You should've seen Jamie-Lynn. She looked exactly like "Maxim" Hot 100 honoree Jasmine Sanders.''',
          '''Guard: It just seems like you wanna be with Jamie-Lynn. I mean, you keep talking about her thigh gap.
Captain Holt: That's my favorite part of a woman. There's nothing more intoxicating than the clear absence of a penis.''',
          '''Amy: This is a dead end. Maybe I should call Seamus Murphy before it's too late.
Captain Holt: I thought we agreed that's a bad idea.
Amy: What other options do we have?
Charles: There is still the podcast.''',
          '''Jake: You know what? I think my Blizz is wearing off. I should probably go lie down.
Romero: Yeah. The diarrhea's coming. That is very common. Don't let the volume scare you.
Jake: Wait. Volume as in noise or amount? Oh, God, it's both, isn't it?''',
          '''Captain Holt: Squad, I think I'm onto something. I was listening to an episode of Boyle's podcast.
Charles: Not the one Terry was on, I hope.
Captain Holt: No, of course not. That one was problematic.
Sergeant Jeffords: What did I do that was so wrong?''',
          '''Captain Holt: Everyone on the ground!
Amy: Put down your weapons!
Charles: You're being recorded for a podcast! You will sign a consent form.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Pawn to king square five, king's knight to the third square on the bishop's file, queen takes on F7! Checkmate! Now, that's a chess move. Buh-bye now.''',
          '''Charles: You used all the touching time, Amy. I get 100% of the goodbye touching time. 100%.''',
          '''Guard: There's an incident in the yard. We're going into lockdown. Inmates, line up.
Jake: No. No, no, no, no, no. I have 50 more minutes. I need this.
Guard: Back to your cells right now.
Charles: No! My touching time.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I've been on the phone for six hours and I just wanna cancel an account. Yes, you've mentioned the bundles and I don't want home phone service. No, do not transfer me, Rodrigo no, no! No, Rodrigo!''',
          '''Rosa: I can't believe it took that long. I really thought the cable company was gonna break you.
Captain Holt: It did. But the good news is, you now have Epix, plus some channel called "Tunez," with a Z. Two-year commitment.''',
          '''Samuel Miller: Prosecution claims you stole $26 million, but they can't trace that money to you in any way.
Jake: Yeah, I have negative $73 in my bank account. Ba-boom!
Amy: I'm somehow embarrassed and proud of you at the same time.
Jake: Yeah, that's my sweet spot.''',
          '''Samuel Miller: Okay, so that's where we stand. Are there any questions or comments?
Captain Holt: Yes, there's something I'd like to say. Don't lose.
Sergeant Jeffords: Thought that was gonna be longer.
Jake: I loved it.
Rosa: It was perfect.''',
          '''Jake: See? When the Nine-Nine puts our brains together, we can achieve anything.
Hey, we should team up and rob banks for real!
Judge Marinovich: You should stop talking in the hallway.
Jake: Yep, copy that. Nice to see you.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Look. I know you're innocent, but fleeing the country is a crime. I could arrest you right here.
Rosa: Do it then. I didn't think so. The mortgage is paid off. You can give the place to whoever you want. I don't care. Actually, I do care. Don't give it to Hitchcock.''',
          '''Amy: Let's go back to New York. You can choose the music.
Jake: Just put on anything by Enya. No, not anything. "Orinoco Flow." On repeat.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I still have reservations about this plan. Perhaps you could say your dealer ran out or he's summering in Nantucket.''',
          '''Charles: If anything happens to Jake, I'll never forgive myself. My last words to him were, "No, you're the man."
Sergeant Jeffords: That actually sounds pretty nice, Boyle.
Charles: Nice isn't good enough, Sarge.''',
          '''Gina: Okay, I should be back in an hour. If my desk phone rings, just ignore it. I don't answer it anyway.
Sergeant Jeffords: You shouldn't tell me stuff like that.''',
          '''Lieutenant Melanie Hawkins: You tank the operation, and you put one of my men out of commission. I am this close to suspending the both of you.
Jake: Almost looked like your fingers were actually touching.''',
          '''Hitchcock: Last night, Scully said he was sick, so I went by myself. Guess who was there, healthy as a clam? Mr. Liar and his new tart Cindy Shatz. What happened to our bro code? Badge before va-
Sergeant Jeffords: Hitchcock, no.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Gina, as you know, my fountain pen is being re-nibbed in Germany.
Gina: Yes, it's all no one is talking about.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Due to its absence, I borrowed Amy's favorite pen, and I lost it.
Gina: That pen is her best friend. I'm not even saying that as an insult. I've heard her say it.''',
          '''Jake: Final question. Is this little Raymond's macaroni art?
Laverne Holt: No, that's a macaroni infographic he made about educational spending during the Johnson administration.
Jake: Oh, of course it is. I love it.''',
          '''Captain Holt: There's something so devious about taking advantage of wine lovers. But there won't be any wine where you're headed, George. Unless you make it in a toilet. Toilet wine. Let's bring him in, Peralta.''',
          '''Charles: Don't get jealous. She left you something too.
Gina: Oh, that's so nice of her. And it's a big jar of brown sludge that smells like death.
Charles: Oh, you got the mother dough!
Gina: Ugh! Did this come out of her? Charles, how grossed out should I be right now?''',
          '''Gina: Charles, if it's so great, why would she give it to me? I barely knew her.
Charles: You know what, she probably got you confused with my cousin Tina. He was always her favorite.
Gina: Tina is a boy's name?
Charles: Yeah, short for Christina.
Gina: Mm.''',
          '''Rosa: What are you looking all wistful about?
Jake: Just thinking, about relationships and love, and how I'm way better at them than I thought I'd be. Should I do a TED Talk on it?
Rosa: Doesn't seem any dumber than all the other TED Talks.''',
          '''Jake: Amy's not in the break room.
Rosa: Or the evidence room.
Hitchcock: Or the ladies' bathroom. You know what? I'll check again.
Rosa: I've never seen him walk with such purpose. What a wretched man.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: I don't know. I'm just trying to build a fun world. That's what model trains are all about: imagination.
Captain Holt: No, they're about accuracy. People like to see the world around them exactly as it is, but smaller.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Hello, Dylan. I'm Captain Holt. We have some trains here to play with, like this one that carries coal and rivets, the two main exports of our town. Would you like to transport some coal or rivets?''',
          '''Jake: Captain, I'm sorry that things got out of hand, but you can still be on the board. I read 85 pages of the convention bylaws, and-
Captain Holt: That was unnecessary. I don't wanna be on the board.
Jake: But I read bylaws.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I wanna show you a picture from last night that really upset me.
Jake: Okay, but in my defense, Rosa bet me 50 cents that I couldn't drink all that shampoo.
Captain Holt: That's not what I wanted to- You drank shampoo?
Jake: What? No. You're the one farting bubbles.''',
          '''Captain Holt: This isn't an excuse for you to party. This is a police convention, not the Newport Folk Festival.''',
          '''Jake: Why are you acting so weird?
Sergeant Jeffords: I'm nervous. I'm gonna talk to Captain Holt about getting me more responsibility. Well, got to go. Die Hard. Explosions. Whatever.
Jake: Wait, no! Just when the conversation was getting interesting!''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Where the hell is Moo Moo?
Jake: Oh, no. I think Terry has a child named Moo Moo, and we forgot to pick her up.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Attention, squad. Here's where we stand vis-à-vis whether or not the precinct will be shut down. The precinct will be shut down.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Besides, it's not about me wanting the record. It's about who currently has it. Hitchcock.
Rosa: Hitchcock?
Hitchcock: Hitchcock?''',
          '''Amy: You can still mentor me if we don't work together. We could meet for breakfast every day. You could teach me over eggs.
Captain Holt: Eggs for breakfast? You're further behind than I thought.''',
          '''Captain Holt: There are two acceptable sleep positions. On back, toes up, arms crossed, or on back, toes up, arms at the side.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Attention, squad. I just got off the phone with One Police Plaza. The hearing is over, and here's where we stand vis-à-vis the precinct being shut down. The precinct will not be shut down.''',

Jake: I love clouds; they keep the sun away on hot days.
Rosa: He doesn't want us to solve this crime, so he's buying us off. It's shady.
Jake: I love the shade; it keeps the sun away on hot days.''',
          '''Captain Holt: So Grayson's a philanderer. What's that gotta do with the price of onions?''',
          '''Jake: Why'd you have to say he was boring?
Amy: Because he is boring. His favorite app on his phone is "contacts."''',

          '''Charles: Is this where people are freaking out? Because we are freaking out.
Rosa: Teddy dinged the One-Five for having roaches.
Jake: So what? We don't have roaches. Our rats ate all of them.
Rosa: That's the problem. We have rats.
Jake: Right, right, right, right, that's worse.''',
          '''Charles: Oh, God, they're gonna shut this precinct down and separate me and Jake. Our friendship is over. If he doesn't see my face every day, he'll forget who I am. He's like a goldfish.''',

Old Lady: Ahem.
Sergeant Jeffords: Oh, not you, ma'am. You reek of life.''',

Gina: Ugh, I hate when you say those things back-to-back.''',

Captain Holt: So says the hair guy. Stay in your lane, bucko.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Whatever.
Captain Holt: "Whatever." Spoken like a common criminal.''',

          '''Amy: Charles, you're going so fast.
Charles: I don't have a choice. We can't let this place fill up with perps.
Amy: Yeah, but you're gonna cramp.
Charles: (chuckling) Are you kidding, baby? I've been cramping for the past 20 minutes.
Amy: I'm so attracted to you right now.''',
          '''Sharon: Guys, my water just broke.
Jake: Don't worry about that, we'll just get you another one.
Oh, you mean your body water! That's much worse.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I'm fine. I'm getting a lot of work done here at Gina's desk. It's wonderful. She has all my favorite chewing gums.''',
          '''Charles: I mean, the problem is, we only have one fax machine, and it takes four minutes per page. It's Logjam City, Jake. Logjam City!''',
          '''Jake: You stay here and take care of Sharon.
Gina: Ugh. What if she's still pregnant when I get in there?
Jake: Then you'll deal with it.''',
          '''Charles: Hey, guys. I just discovered a new drug too. It's called "your relationship," and I'm high on it.
Jake: Charles, I'm gonna need you to back off, man.
Charles: Roger that.
Jake: Yeah.''',
          '''Amy: Our only close call was when Jake didn't know who Will Shortz was.
Captain Holt: Really? Never heard of the Puzzlemaster?
This is who you want to be with? I shouldn't get involved.
Good luck with the case.''',
          '''Jake: So I marked all the corners where taxi has been spotted on this map.
You'll probably notice right away that it makes the shape of a boob.
Amy: This looks great. Confirms Devon's story. He says his dealer hangs out here, in the underboob.''',
          '''Hitchcock: Oh, if you want calm, there's some ludes in evidence, if anybody would ever let me get them out.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: It feels like you're being a little harsh.
Rosa: Thanks, good note. I was going for extremely harsh. I'll turn it up.''',
          '''Gina: Yes, you should do that, or you could just tell him what happened. I mean, he parked in two spots. It's kind of his fault. Just have some B-bone, Boyle.
Charles: You know that's my smallest bone.''',
          '''Jake: That's a code.
Captain Holt: A code? Exciting. I'll go get my pencil case.''',
          '''Amy: You know what your butt hates? Making any sort of sacrifice for us, because it's not serious about this relationship.
Jake: Okay, first of all, my butt is so serious it should be wearing spectacles.''',
          '''Jake: Okay. I know you're mad, but before you say anything, yes, we screwed up. And yes, you warned us. And yes, I don't know where I'm going with this. But I do know this: I have reached the end of my sentence.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Boyle, I thought you should know. I just got Gertie back from the garage.
She looks as good as new. Better, even, because after 12 years, they finally got the Annie Lennox cassette out of the tape player.
Charles: Oh, I love her.''',
          '''Marcus: Uncle Ray, thank you for loaning me you best detective for lunch.
Captain Holt: My pleasure. Of course, she is entitled to 45 minutes as per her union contract.''',
          '''Rosa: Things aren't working out.
I don't want to talk about it.
Captain Holt: I regret the words we've already spoken.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Those woods are full of ticks. It's Lyme disease central.
Jake: So we'll get some bug spray.
Sergeant Jeffords: Plus that cabin's probably covered in black mold.
Jake: Racist.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Yes, it is daunting. But I did some research on amicable breakups.
I visited www.ladiesgoodhealthmag.com/sex-relationships/867599904/9432&20.html.
Do you know that site?
Rosa: No.''',
          '''Gina: Without product makers like you, us dazzle-doves wouldn't have nothing to shake our wings over.''',
          '''Charles: Well, I have exciting news.
I found the perfect guy to set you up with.
Gina: After zero consideration, I'm happy to say, "hard pass."''',
          '''Gina: Charles, it's very sweet that you want to set me up with someone, but I do not trust your taste in guys at all.
Charles: I have spectacular taste in men. You would love Nadia.
Gina: His name is Nadia?
Charles: Oh, all of a sudden Nadia's not a cool name? You are impossible.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Hey while I'm in there, should I get you a soda?
Captain Holt: I know you're joking, but on the off chance you aren't, no.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Hello, Peralta.
Jake: Captain.
Captain Holt: Midnight nears.
Jake: Yes, it does. Tick tock.
Captain Holt: Tick tock indeed.
Jake: But tick tock for who?
Captain Holt: You know it's "for whom." Don't try to provoke me.''',
          '''Gina: Good morning.
Captain Holt: For whom?
Gina: For you-m.''',
          '''Jake: Why do you follow people's directions when you could literally pick them up and throw them out the window?''',
          '''Captain Holt: What's going on?
Jake: Well, Gina said we couldn't be seen together, and I need your help. Looks like we've both got a pretty bad case of jerk boss.
Captain Holt: Yes, yours is an idiot, and mine is a fork-tongued lizard witch.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Now, before we begin in earnest, I'd like to propose a toast.
Jake: *gasps* That's what globes are for.
Captain Holt: A 25-year-old port seems appropriate.
Gina: I would have gone 10.
Jake: I don't know what port is.''',
          '''Jake: This is so much fun!
Hit me in the face.
*groans* Oh, that was a terrible suggestion.''',
          '''The Vulture: All right, sluggers. Let's see what you got for the big b-day bash.
Amy: I thought you wanted us to surprise you.
The Vulture: It's a figure of speech, Detective Stupid-ago.''',
          '''Amy: Well, I was thinking a DJ, two signature cocktails, passed hors d'oeuvres-
The Vulture: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Passed hors d'oeuvres? What is this, a fundraiser for French dorks?''',
          '''Rosa: Oh, my God. You friended the vulture?
Amy: Well, he's not telling us anything, so it was the only way to figure out what he likes.
Rosa: Maybe this will help. He just said his favorite color is underboob.''',
          '''Rosa: Your hard work just paid off.
Amy: The vulture is in a band? "Fantastic Jack and the Junkyard Rats."
Rosa: Just when I thought he couldn't be any more the worst, he out the worsts himself.''',
          '''Jake: Sir, we're tracking a serial killer. There's nothing better. We're living the dream.
Captain Holt: That's your dream. Mine was to run the Nine-Nine, and that will never happen again.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: I'm Terry Jeffords, and when I put my mind to something, I do it. My resting heart rate is six. Six!''',
          '''Rosa: Hiring him to play his own party is straight-up brilliant.
Amy: Yep, because everything he does is a prank on himself.
Rosa: Wow, you're an evil genius. Next time I want to hurt someone, I'm coming straight to you.
Amy: Aw, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.''',
          '''Jake: Hey, donut holes. Don't mind if I do.
Eurgh! Fish? Fish donuts, Boyle? What is wrong with you?
Charles: It's takoyaki. I'm drowning my sorrows in octopus balls.''',
          '''Jake: Now, I see that as a positive story. Out of all the identities he could have stolen. He chose yours! And you want to know why?
Charles: Because I posted my annual income?
Jake: Because you posted your annual income, you moron.''',
          '''Charles: My hunch is that it's a jealous ex-lover. Girl like that, three dogs, makes her own turkey stock, that's the kind of woman you don't get over.''',
          '''Genevieve: Does Charles have a girlfriend?
Charles: I just saw her mouth my name. What did she say? Is she asking if I'm circumcised?
Jake: What? No! Who asks that? Stop interrupting.''',
          '''Gallery owner: Get out of here.
Charles: Fine, but we're taking this. Because you don't deserve that memory.
Gallery owner: That painting's $95,000.
Charles: I don't want it anyway. Your penis was on it.''',
          '''Charles: Good one. This is fantastic. I mean, I'm not happy that she was having sex with another man, but I'm okay with it if that's what gets her off.
Jake: Do you seriously not hear it? Because it almost seems intentional at this point.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I've been asked to deliver a toast here after the funeral, a message of hope. This is what I have so far. "Pain!"
That's it.''',
          '''Jake: Hey, Captain. I was looking for you inside.
The Vulture: One thing I won't do is fart in church. This is God's house.
Jake: Oh, respectful.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Can I be honest? Precinct's not the same without you. The Vulture's the worst. My mango yogurt-
Captain Holt: Yes, you already mentioned the yogurt.
Sergeant Jeffords: 'Cause it's important!''',
          '''Rosa: Dude, you can't go through life trying not to get hurt.
You should try to be happy.
Charles: So you think I should look for someone I can have emotional intercourse with?
Rosa: I wish you hadn't said it like that, but yeah.''',
          '''Jake: You also got a hair cut.
At some point in your life, I'm sure.
That's not your baby hair. That would be crazy.''',
          '''Seth Dozerman: According to your Dozer-pad, four of your colleagues have been gathered around your desk for the last ninety seconds.
Also, someone named Norm Scully has been in the bathroom for the last seventy-two minutes.
Jake: Oh, yeah, that means he's about half way.''',
          '''Rosa: So, what is this? Casual, serious? I need to know how to make fun of you.''',
          '''Madeline Wuntch: I like what you've done with your office, Raymond. It's cozy. Like a shoebox one buries a dead hamster in.''',
          '''Dozer-pad: You are forty-three minutes behind.
Sergeant Jeffords: I know! Get off my back, computer ghost!''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Case cleared. How you like me now, sucker? I mean, I hope you found peace.''',
          '''Gina: Captain? The kids want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is. I told them he got sucked up into an airplane engine, is that all right?''',
          '''Captain Holt: I can't put that pigeon head on, Gina. Wuntch has defeated me. This is how it ends. With me standing on the urine soaked floor of an elementary school bathroom in a third-rate bird costume.''',
          '''Jake: So, apparently the new Captain survived. And his heart attack, not the craziest thing that happened at the precinct today. We kissed. Like three hours ago.''',
          '''Amy: Rule number 3: Let's not have sex right away.
Jake: Cool. Cool cool cool cool cool. No doubt, no doubt, no doubt. Good rule. No sex. Good rule.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Wuntch.
Madeline Wuntch: Hello, Raymond. You're looking old and sickly.''',
          '''Rosa: What the hell are these?
Seth Dozerman: These are Dozer-pads. Each one is equipped with a GPS system and a countdown clock to remind you to complete a task every fifty-five minutes. It also has backgammon on it, which I could not delete but you are not allowed to play.''',
          '''Jake: In the immortal words of Amy Santiago, girlfriend please!''',
          '''Captain Holt: Madeline Wuntch is making me head of relations for the NYPD. I'm being forced out of the Nine-Nine. I don't wish to make a big deal of it, so please limit your reactions to one second. Go.
Sergeant Jeffords: Why...?
Gina: What...?
Captain Holt: That's plenty.''',
          '''Rosa: That will never happen. In fact, you've just lost Rosa privileges. From now on, you can call me Diaz or Hey You.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Don't count your gross fish babies before they've hatched, Madeline.''',
          '''Madeline Wuntch: So you've got an audience for this spectacle?
Captain Holt: Yes, well, who wouldn't want to see a man fight a crocodile.''',
          '''Captain Holt: You have until tomorrow, you grackle.''',
          '''Jake: All right, there's only one way out of this for me. I've got to get super cruel. Prepare to have your physical flaws pointed out, Amy. I'm talking about your tall butt and your weird elbows.''',
          '''Jake: Who do you think it's gonna be?
Sergeant Jeffords: I've no idea.
Hitchcock: I bet it's me. I just hope I'm ready.''',
          '''Amy: I'm in! A bet which improves someone's manners? Double score.''',
          '''Jake: For the record, you're turning this murder scene into a real bummer-scape.''',
          '''Amy: I'm sorry. I tried to be myself and they hated it.''',
          '''Jake: Did you know that my dream has always been to have my picture taken with a mountain of recovered cash?
Charles: And it's always been my dream to take that picture of you, Jake.''',
          '''Amy: Sir, please let the record show that the sauce on his face is from yesterday. And it's that level of eagle-eyed observation that I plan to-
Captain Holt: Enough.''',
          '''Gina: We're throwing Terry a "Please Stay" party. My vision is a frozen yogurt machine operated by Pam Grier.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: What's that smell? That's lavender. Terry loves lavender.''',
          '''Rosa: Why the long face? That Mexican candy giving you nerve damage again?
Jake: Probably, but who even cares.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: If I worked at Copperhead, I'd be home by now. Swimming in a pool of gold coins like my boy, Scrooge McDuck.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Well, I've used the sick excuse for you eight times. I think they're catching on.
Rosa: You could say you're sick.
Captain Holt: No one would ever believe that.''',
          '''Gina: I will be there. All I ask is you clear the furniture out of your living room so I can show Kev some of my new dance opera.
Rosa: Why just some of it? Do the whole thing.
Captain Holt: Yes. Nothing would make me happier. See you Thursday at 8.''',
          '''Charles: No, I was out getting him some healing broth. I was torn between chicken or beef, but then it hit me, goat.''',
          '''Jake: I don't have a problem. I'm just trying to solve this case, and everyone's making a huge deal because I have a few minor injuries to my ribs, ankle, hand, toes and jaw.
Charles: Jaw?
Jake: Yeah, that just happened. I got hit in the face with a box.''',
          '''Jake: Okay, fine. I accept my fate. Just take a picture of my penis first, for posterity, then do what you must.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Are your senses heightened?
Rosa: I think I might be pregnant, not bitten by a radioactive spider.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: You happy now? Broken ribs and a million broken toes weren't enough for you?
Jake: In retrospect they were plenty, yes.''',
          '''Jake: Okay. This is everyone I could think of who'd want to mess with my life. Perps, people I've testified against, the old guy who lived underneath me when I was learning the Gangnam style dance.''',
          '''Jake: My power went out last night and my alarm didn't go off.
Amy: Your alarm is power dependent? You brought this on yourself, son.''',
          '''Jake: Captain, this is insane. I don't do drugs. Sure, a couple of my teeth are loose, but that's from dental neglect not meth.''',
          '''Charles: I grew a goatee and it looks amazing, and I know you can see it.
Rosa: Of course we can see it, Charles. It's horrible.''',
          '''Jake: Captain Holt, come meet my dad, Captain Peralta.
Captain Peralta: Hello, captain.
Captain Holt: Captain.
Jake: This is super weird for me.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: You probably can't tell, but I'm flexing my brain like crazy right now.''',
          '''Rosa: You use the seesaw to press down on their necks until fatty confesses.
Captain Holt: Incorrect. And disturbing.''',
          '''Jake: That's my dad. The captain talking right now. I came out of his body. No big deal.''',
          '''Jake: Sorry, Scully, we only had two uniforms.
Scully: It's okay. For some reason, all the fries and gravy, and cheese upset my tummy.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Those islanders and their pathetic seesaw haunt my dreams. They mock me in my sleep. Riding up and down in a teeter-totter of taunts.''',
          '''Charles: We are going to be brother and sister. And to think this started with us just going to town on each other's sexy parts.
Gina: Ew. Charles, promise me that is not in your toast.
Charles: It's not?''',
          '''Jake: Guys, guess who I'm about to see.
Charles: The Boobs? Michael Buble?
Jake: You're the only one who calls him that.''',
          '''Gina: My mom's priest dropped out so I need one of you two to step up. Urgh, who would be better equipped to deliver a heart-felt, emotional speech about love?
Captain Holt: I have to imagine it's not me.''',
          '''Gina: My mom likes champagne, baked ziti, the Bahamas. Charles's dad probably lives under a bridge and uses a puddle as a mirror. I don't know.''',
          '''Gina: Captain, the speech is yours. It needs to be emotional and poetic. Can you do it?
Captain Holt: Well, my first captain used to call me Emily Dickinson.
Gina: Great.
Captain Holt: Of course he meant it as an insult about my sexuality, but don't worry. I am good at emotion.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Marriage is a con-tract
Between two adults of- different families.
It's a Haiku. And a fact. It works on two levels.''',

          '''Captain Holt: Bad mood? I'm sorry, have I not being bursting into song enough for you lately? Would you like me to click my heels together or skip like a school child?
Jake: Yes, to all of that.''',
          '''Kevin: Well, I remember that morning. He left the house at seven and was in a great mood. In fact, he was still chuckling about the previous night's Charlie Rose.''',
          '''Captain Holt: What is wrong with our Internet? I like to back up my data every fifteen minutes and it's taking seventeen minutes per backup. I'm in a data backup deficit.''',
          '''Gina: We're here so I can activate the Holy Network of Administrative Assistants, acronym HNAA. We high-level assistants keep track of what's going on with all the bosses. Jealous, Amy?''',
          '''Charles: He's messing with me because I'm not intimidating like Terry or dignified like Jake. Or model-handsome like Jake. Or funny like Jake.''',
          '''Charles: Yeah, I might buy my shoes at a kids store and yeah, I might be scared of geese, but I am a damn good cop and I will not be made a fool of. So I am gonna go into that room and I'm gonna get that lousy, old geezer to admit on camera that he robbed those banks.''',
          '''Jake: Wait, so you heroically fought off three guys and that put you in a bad mood? If I did that, I would literally write a song about myself. It would be like "Jake the hero. Abs of steel. She-la-la-la."''',
          '''Captain Holt: I wasn't injured. I was lightly stabbed.
Kevin: I'm sorry. You were stabbed?
Captain Holt: Lightly stabbed. I didn't want to frighten you.''',
          '''Captain Holt: You were right all along. I wasn't mad at you, I was mad at myself, and I took it out on the squad. Peralta you're a genius.
Jake: Oh my God, you said it.
Captain Holt: I heard you practising in the men's room.
Jake: Yeah, that makes more sense.''',
          '''Rosa: Well, I have plans on Saturday, too. I'm having dinner with my parents.
Amy: So? You don't even like your parents. You call them smiley morons and hug freaks.
Rosa: Plans are plans. I'm a bad ass, not an anarchist.''',
          '''Gina: I need someone to take this personality test for my psych class. I was hoping to wow my professor with a genuine psycho. Like Amy. Or Hitchcock. Or Charles would be great.''',

Agent Kendrick: Yes, precisely.
Jake: No!
Hitchcock: Jackpot!''',

Charles: Beat them up?
Jake: Pretend to be sick and lure them in here.
Charles: Right, the Charles.''',

Rosa: Buddy.
Jake: Yes, that might be adrenaline talking.''',

          '''Jake: I catharted.
Sergeant Jeffords: You catharted hard.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Gina, you're tenacious, you're strong. You're a great leader. And, most importantly, any basic bitch would be lucky to be like you.''',
          '''Gina: It's crazy how much he flirts with me.''',
          '''Amy: Why didn't you tell me? I had no idea things were getting that serious.
Rosa: Yeah, it's very embarrassing having feelings.''',

Captain Holt: Oh, you and I both know what Mother Jeffords would say. Take the high road. But I asked you, Detective Diaz, because you understand vengeance.''',

Jake: Only because we're equally massive, beautiful men in tuxes.''',

Gina: Seventeen texts. All of them important.''',

          '''Amy: I've got to tell the captain. Do you think he'll be upset?
Sergeant Jeffords: Probably not. I mean he seems like the kind of laid back guy who delights in having his mistakes exposed. Maybe next year you can do a collage about low points in his marriage.''',
          '''Darlene Linetti: A digital scale? Lynn Boyle, you're a horrible, horrible man. You went way over our price limit. And I love it!''',

Captain Holt: Yes, the Nog from Egg-Nog used in place of knock.''',
          '''Jake: You are not to enjoy it.
Doug Judy: I can't help it. I'm proud of you. You're like a son to me. A white, crispy son.
Jake: How would that even work? Am I adopted?
Doug Judy: No, your mother's just really pale. Almost invisible.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: What's going on, Diaz, are you sick?
Gina: Do you have cholera? Is it typhoid? Are you a vampire? My horoscope said to wear a cowl neck today and I laughed!''',

          '''Charles: And I'm Twink Tucker.
Jake: You cannot choose your own name any more.
Charles: I got a job at the docks to support my drug habit, but I kept it - (In an Irish accent) Because I love the seagulls.
Jake: What, are you Irish now? No.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Anyway, tomorrow's my anniversary with Kevin. I'd like to cook him an impressive breakfast. Could you help orient me with that process?
Charles: I'd be honored. Preparing food for one's lover is the most intimate gift of all. Aside from washing their hair.''',
          '''Amy: I had an airtight breakup plan in place. I made a reservation next thursday at a well-lit Korean restaurant in midtown. It's the least romantic place I could think of.

          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Okay, if Diaz won't accept our help, we got to go behind her back.
Gina: We definitely should go behind her back. That's the opposite side of where the germs are coming from.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Just let me help you. I'll get your perp to talk. I can be very persuasive.
I just negotiated my baby girls down from a pony to a hamster.''',

Captain Holt: This isn't burning man, Boyle. Tell me what I'm eating.
Charles: Fine. It's a sharp Vermont Cabot. Now describe what you taste.
Captain Holt: Cheese.
Charles: And...
Captain Holt: Cheese.''',
          '''Charles: Okay, I was looking for more of an emotional connection.
For example, my favorite meal is a simple roast chicken and potatoes. It was the only dish my mother knew how to cook, and when I eat it, I feel as though I am once again inside her womb.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: That's better than my excuse. I said I had to go to my girls' bat mitzvahs.''',
          '''Charles: Okay, we're looking for room 247, agent Jack Danger.
Jake: Agent Jack danger? Wow, that name is buh-dass.

Jake: Yeah.
Charles: So buh-dass.''',

          '''Amy: What's going on? Is this a dream? No, I'm not holding a label maker.''',
          '''Rosa: What the hell? Danger just called and said you abandoned him, took information from a classified computer, and licked a roll of antique stamps.
Charles: The stamps were on me. I was curious about how old glue tasted. Answer, like a horse lollipop.''',
          '''Jake: More importantly, I was not able to find any "heat" because it's more of a concept. But we did find these beauties. They're all faux-fur and all the best brands. We've got Chanelb, Grucci, Stella McCarkey's.''',

Captain Holt: Good, sounds like we dodged a bullet there.''',

Rosa: Movie's hilarious.
Jake: Okay, surprising opinion.
We'll talk about that later.''',
          '''Hitchcock: What about me?
Jake: Uh, I guess I could have a friend throw some pretzels up to you from the street?
Hitchcock: And soda too?
Jake: Fine, I'll have someone blindly throw ice-cold metal cans of soda at you.''',
          '''Jake: Scully, I need you to help Boyle. Don't worry about Hitchcock. He'll be fine. I once saw him fall down three flights of stairs, get up, and keep eating his hot dog, like nothing happened.
Scully: You're right. He's the strongest man we know.
Jake: No.''',
          '''Jake: Full disclosure, your honor. Last night, Ms. Perez and I got inebriated and we had colitis.
Judge: Colitis?
Sophia: Coitus.
Jake: Yeah, that.''',

Jake: That's what I'm talking about! Super dark, Boyle, but way more plausible than the sarge's idiotic alarm clock theory.''',
          '''Captain Holt: It's 9:00 A.M. Why is no one working?
Jake: Amy Santiago is a few minutes late, and we're all trying to guess why.
Captain Holt: I'd like to play. I'd say she's in line at the bank. This is fun.''',
          '''Jake: All right, fine. I get what you're saying. Your wife's awesome and I should do everything in my power to be with her physically.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Now you've done it. You've made me turn my chair. I will not get involved, and I will not have this office transformed into a house of snipes and jabs. Dismissed.''',

Amy: Fine. I'll get my stuff, but this better not bite me in the ass.
Jake: "Better not bite me in the ass" is the name of your sex tape. But seriously, thank you so much for your help.''',
          '''Amy: Gina, is everything okay? You never text me. Look, the last message I got from you was August 3rd, 2009. You wrote, "Sup, Rosa?" Followed by "Never mind."''',
          '''Rosa: How'd you get involved in dealing giggle?
Sergeant Jeffords: Wait, wait, wait, wait. We gotta back this up. After pre-school, did you go to private or public elementary?
Suspect: Private.
Sergeant Jeffords: When were you potty-trained?''',
          '''Jake: Scully and Hitchcock, I'm just gonna call you your real names so you don't get confused.
Scully: Smart.
Hitchcock: (Confused) What?''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Oh, my God. Is everything okay with your family?
Gina: Family, what? No, this is serious. Floorgasm just came by and danced me out of the group.''',
          '''Gina: And while I generally nail everything, I'm just having trouble balancing my studies and my passion for dance.
Sergeant Jeffords: Plus, you're working full-time.
Gina: Yeah, that actually doesn't factor into it whatsoever.''',

Gina: He's in a fight club.''',

          '''Captain Holt: This took a lot of hard work and a lot of late nights. Take the weekend off, Perlata.

Sergeant Jeffords: Yes. That's the whole point of it.
Jake: Seriously? That seems lame.''',

Captain Holt: Yes. I saw a draft of it on your desk.
Rosa: What did you think?
Captain Holt: It was so horrifying I had to destroy the whole pad.''',

          '''The Vulture: You were working a case. I freaking knew it. You're a liar.
Madeline Wuntch: And you. You can't do anything except disobey orders and screw up.
Bob: I'm disappointed, too.
Madeline Wuntch: No one cares, Bob.''',
          '''Charles: Light and breezy is how you describe a linen pant-suit. Not a relationship you care about.''',

Rosa: Who accidentally hit reply all like some idiot on an brunch thread.''',

          '''Amy: Hey, Ray, it's time.
Captain Holt: For what, detective Santiago?
Amy: You to give me a promotion and a forty-percent raise. I've been carrying this squad for two years, and my back's getting tired.''',
          '''Charles: I want that room, Gina. You can't push me around. We're not Poke Pals any more.
Gina: Eww!''',
          '''Captain Holt: I hope there's a lot of drug activity there. Of course, ideally there will be nobody taking drugs there or anywhere else in the district. But if drugs must be found, let it be there. Please God let it be there.''',
          '''Jake: There he is. My groom!
Charles: Hello my big, beautiful BM.
Jake: Best man. Just best man is fine.''',
          '''Jake: I always talk about smart stuff. You know, the jazz age, what's in a name, the 1950s movies that are from the '50s.
Captain Holt: Those were the categories on Jeopardy last night.''',
          '''Deputy Chief Gerber: Detective Boyle, I just wanted to say congratulations. Your medal was well deserved.
Charles: Thank you, sir. Your breath is terrible.''',

          '''Gina: (To Amy) Did you make the cover of "Hair Pulled Back" magazine?''',
          '''Rosa: Why do you care so much about some old reporter?
Jake: Some old reporter? Is the sky just some big blue hat that the world wears?
Rosa: No. And no one has ever thought that.
Jake: My point exactly.''',

Amy: Holt wants us to get that block party permit.
Rosa: Damn it. I guess I'll take the knife out of my pants.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Boyle?
Charles: [crying] Nikolaj is a picky eater! I lied about his palate. All he drinks is milk. All he eats is buttered noodles.
Captain Holt: And perhaps my walnut pie?
Charles: I wish. He hates nuts. My son is a basic bitch.''',
          '''Amy: I don't understand, who took it?
Rosa: We haven't heard from Charles in an hour. Maybe he betrayed The Tramps. Oh, God, I just called us The Tramps. What have I become?''',

          '''Gina: I came back, wearing the perfect disguise to make sure I was never noticed by anyone. Something so drab and uninspiring-

Jake: Just can't stop.
Amy: I'll let you guys talk! I'll just close my eyes.''',

Amy: No, you weren't part of this. Get back over to the loser side, loser.''',

Rosa: Disagree. This is an amazing use of time. We have complete control over that dummy's birthday party. We can ruin it.
Amy: Yeah, fun. I'll just mess up a captain's orders on purpose. It'll be so - I can't even fake it.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: They'll deny everything. We need hard proof.
Rosa: So, let's get it. Step one, put a delicious pie in the fridge and cover it with poison.
Sergeant Jeffords: That's step one? What's step two?
Rosa: Tell their widows they were thieves.''',
          '''Amy: We're gonna take a page from the Vulture's book.
Jake: The Big Book of Small Butts?

Rosa: Also we cleaned up the streets.
Captain Holt: Yeah, that's good too.''',

Jake: Urgh.
Amy: Yeuck.
Gina: Eww.''',

Jake: Well, it's my least favorite type of cake, so rarely. If I have to, I'll just eat the frosting.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Sorry about your hand.
Charles: Thanks. It makes it really hard to manipulate my egg sack.''',

"You know what the toughest part of being a gay black police officer is?
The discrimination."
I believe that's what you call observational humor.''',

Charles: It's mine. I brought it from home.''',
          '''Charles: I borrowed the waiter's phone when you weren't looking and bought me and Vivian plane tickets to Rome.

          '''Jake: Irwin, how would you like the honour of being the first man to undress in front of Amy Santiago?''',

          '''Captain Holt: Are you familiar with the story of Moneyball? A man uses statistics and logic to win several baseball games. It's my favorite film.''',
          '''Charles: We spent two weeks undercover infiltrating the gym. Gymfiltrating it. I coined that. I think it'll really catch on if more people infiltrated gyms.''',
          '''Charles: Yeah, that's why I never tried to develop an edge. You can't lose what you don't have. No surprise.''',
          '''Jake: Okay, Boyle, you live in your ex-wife's new boyfriend's basement. I'm not taking advice from you.
Charles: I'm ashamed of my living situation!''',
          '''Amy: Captain, you look-
Captain Holt: No.''',
          '''Charles: Gina, you're just trying to hurt me to distract you from your own internal pain. Also, you should use less conditioner, because this is a flat mess.''',
          '''Jake: Yes. I've got you now Pontiac Bandit. Whoo! It feels good to say that in front of actual people, instead of just the mirror.''',
          '''Gina: Welcome to the Boyle-free zone. Please turn of all cell phones so as not to attract any unwanted attention. Can I offer you a mint?''',
          '''Charles: Hit him in his fat, rosy cheeks.
Jake: Oh, that felt wrong.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Okay. Excuse me. Can we please eat? My body is starting to digest itself. Terry needs nutrients!''',
          '''Captain Holt: You look like a corpse we just pulled out of the river.
Jake: Wrong. I look like a cool rock star who just OD'd in his own pool. Big difference.''',
          '''Charles: You could eat off his shirt.
Captain Holt: Why would I ever eat off his shirt?''',
          '''Charles: You know some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers. Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Let you play your mixtape? Get an iPod, man! Mixtape.''',
          '''Rosa: Don't arrest him. Just smack him. Hard. With a phone book on a body part no one can see. Know what I'm saying?
Jake: So you're suggesting police brutality?
Rosa: *laughing* I guess so, why?''',
          '''Jake: Okay, you know when you use the word rabbi it turns me on, and that is unfair in the work environment. Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass.''',
          '''Captain Holt: We need your help, Gina.
Gina: Gina, ugh, I haven't heard that name in a long time.
Sergeant Jeffords: It's on your jacket.
Gina: I know, but no one says it out loud and my baby can't read. Which, I'm told is normal for a ten-week-old.''',
          '''Gina: Nobody can ever know that we had sex, all right. I have spent years cultivating a reputation as somebody who sleeps with bike messengers or better.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: We need to soften up your look. My wife and Charles's mom both donated some clothes.
Rosa: Your wife and Boyle's mom are both blind?''',

Jake: Shh. Turn off your mouth siren.''',
          '''Jake: Oh, come on, really? I'm a few minutes late so you're going to call me out in front of everyone?
Captain Holt: Good idea. Everyone? Gather around. So I can call out Peralta in front of you.''',
          '''Rosa: Ugh. She'll probably get ten years. It's better than 30. Let's be real, Debbie's life wasn't gonna begin till she was 50 anyway.
Jake: Yeah, the kooky aunt vibe will probably play a lot better then.''',
          '''Jake: Look, we can handle this, sir. Do we joke around sometimes? Yes, but when it's time to buckle down, we're seasoned professionals.
Charles: That's why they call us the Spice Boys.
Jake: They don't and they won't.''',
          '''Rosa: You know, some people say, "Mo money, mo problems," but those people are idiots. Money's amazing.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: Yup. Next week is my last week at the Nine-Nine.
Brian Floomryde: Attention, everyone. I will be giving up singing. This will be my final performance. [loud and off-key] One pound two ounces-
Amy: Not now, Brian!''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: It's gonna be hard to spot a crazy person in here. They're all crazy.
Jake: Tell me about it. This is more insane than the crowd at the Carly Rae Jepsen- I mean Slayer concert.''',
          '''Jocelyn: Rosa, this is dumb. I'm just gonna go.
Rosa: No, no, no. You promised me more time. I still have seven minutes.
Jocelyn: I really don't want to miss my flight, and I cannot physically stand the way that room smells anymore.
Rosa: Just breathe through your mouth.''',
          '''Charles: Rosa was my leading lady from the start. She's the only good actor here.
Sergeant Jeffords: She is?
Rosa: Yeah, you know nothing about my real life. I'm always acting.''',

Hitchcock: So it got under his butt.
Scully: Happens all the time.
Hitchcock: Sure do.
Jake: Ugh, you guys are horrible.''',
          '''Rosa: The problem is, Commissioner Kelly is never gonna reopen the first floor. We should just fire some of the uniforms. But not you. Uh, we couldn't survive without you, Greg, and also Greg?
James: James and Michael.''',
          '''Rosa: All right, there's only one thing left to do.
Charles: Drink faster.
Rosa: Set a bunch of fires throughout the city. Mine's better.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Even the best laid plans sometimes don't work out.
Gina: They sure don't. And now it's time for Gina's closing thoughts. Just because you wanna do something doesn't mean you get to do it. Life is chaos, success is completely arbitrary, and confidence is everything.''',
          '''Rosa: Gina, since you're leaving, I'd like to make a toast. Bye.
Gina: Oh, my God. That was perfect.''',
          '''Rosa: Anyway, they're both annoyed, and now I have to choose one of them, and I cannot make up my mind. It's insane. I never have trouble making decisions.
[cut to Rosa reading "Sophie's Choice:]
Rosa: Ugh. Choose the daughter.''',
          '''Scully: Hey, thanks for having our back today. These are from the old studs of the Nine-Nine to the new studs.
Jake: Aww.
Charles: Nice. Nice. Well, I think they drank out of these. They're half-empty.
Jake: Definitely. Hitchcock's contact lens is floating in mine.''',
          '''Gina: Charles, what are you doing?
Charles: Damn it, Gina. What does it look like I'm doing? I'm trying to unlock your phone using a mask of your face so I can find out why your mom left my dad.''',
          '''Amy: Hello, sir. Sorry again for tying you spread eagle on the bed.
Captain Holt: Apology not accepted.''',

Rosa: The bane of my existence.
Jake: Bane from "Batman", right? ... Continue.''',
          '''Rosa: What the hell were you thinking? You're lucky you just dislocated your knee.
Amy: How do you know it's dislocated?
Rosa: I went to med school for three years.
Amy: You did? When?
Rosa: That's not the point! Why did you jump off the building?''',
          '''Jake: Okay, Raymond in the Kangol hat, I will definitely call you Raymond, Raymond in the Kangol hat. This is the best night of my life.''',
          '''Hitchcock: We brought you a little gift. I had to guess on cup size.
Rosa: Just gonna burn that for you.
Amy: Thank you.''',
          '''Rosa: Look, we've done like nine rounds of this, and you haven't drunk once. Maybe we should play something else that actually gets you drunk. I love you, dude, but you haven't had the craziest life.''',
          '''Charles: Is that a Serbian accent? It is. Write that down for later. I'll see you in six hours.''',
          '''Captain Holt: That meat was good. You know what we should order? More meat.''',
          '''Jake: All right, here's the deal. Terry's coin fell out of his pocket, and we lost it. We just didn't have the heart to tell you.
Charles: Oh, no. That cost $800. All right, Terry will pay me back later.
Sergeant Jeffords: What?''',
          '''Amy: Okay, so I need to come up with 15 grand or my father/daughter dance is going to be performed by that.''',
          '''Rosa: Never have I ever slept with a guy, broken his heart, hired him to play at my wedding, stolen a legally binding contract from him, jumped on a bar and dumped booze on everyone, fallen off the bar, probably given myself a concussion and a permanent scar.
Amy: I have ever!''',
          '''Jake: I didn't like it because you got kidnapped right at the beginning. You were gone for six hours. I wanted to spend my bachelor party with you.''',
          '''Reginald VelJohnson: Uh, do I still need to be here?
Jake: Yes, Reginald. We're all toasted and we need rides home! [SOFTLY] It's Reginald VelJohnson!''',
          '''Charles: Troy's not home, but I say we wait. I have some hard questions for that rice pudding bastard.''',
          '''Charles: Move your ass, you old bitch!
Jake: What is happening?
Charles: We have to get there by 7:00 when they lift the parking restrictions. It's the best spot in Brooklyn, and everyone wants it. Get the hell out of the way!''',
          '''Gina: You know what, men are difficult because they're all secretly monsters, but now that I know you're bi, that changes everything. I know so many great women.''',
          '''Amy: This is your sister. It's gonna be great. You just have to relax and be yourself.
Jake: But what if myself isn't good enough, you know? What if I'm the Mongkut?''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: I'm totally fine. Here. I can prove it. [stands up slowly, groaning the whole way] I'm fine. See?
Captain Holt: You can't have thought that went well for you.''',
          '''Jake: Bill, did you bring those things I asked for?
Bill: Yep, all of my belongings that you'll need are in this suitcase.
Charles: Why is it vibrating? Is your cell phone in here?
Bill: No.
Jake: I'm sure it's not a sex toy.''',
          '''Jake: Okay, tell us more.
Bill: Now, here's a list of all the nicknames I go by. Big Bill, Big Eric, Big Drew, Big Dave, Super Thick-
Jake: Just write them all down for us.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Oh, it's good to hear. Remember, failure is for failures.''',
          '''Jake: Hey, Charles, nothing's happening on my MAR corner. Any movement at Sam's place?
Charles: No, I did, however, see a cool-looking dude in a ponytail on a Razor scooter. I have to admit, I like the look.''',
          '''Jake: Hey, puzzle chick, unscramble this. You're going to "ailj."''',
          '''Captain Holt: Just got off the phone with the brass. It doesn't look good. They're still trying to decide on a punishment for your actions.
Jake: Well, did you tell them I feel so bad I have a tummy ache?
Captain Holt: I did. They were unaffected.''',
          '''Amy: Okay, two months in a safe house that's not impossible.
Charles: It's nothing. I once stayed in my apartment for 3 1/2 months straight.
Amy: Was that after they canceled "Bunheads"?
Charles: Why would you bring that up?''',
          '''Amy: I don't know what I was thinking. We've been at it for two hours and all we've got is three words.
Sergeant Jeffords: Really two. Terry's just fooling himself. "Apache's" a long shot at best.''',
          '''Captain Holt: All right, go make contact with Diane Keaton's brother-in-law.
Jake: Fredo. It's Fredo. It's one of the most popular movies of all time. Won best picture, so.''',
          '''Gina: But there is one thing: I need a private place where I can pump. I was thinking maybe I could take this whole floor and you guys could move down to that place where we park.
Sergeant Jeffords: The garage?
Gina: Sure, if you think that works.''',
          '''Jake: Love all the lamps.
Kyle Murphy: Thanks. I accidentally ordered 100 lamps instead of one. They only give you, like, a six-month return window, so. You get it.
Jake: Totally.''',
          '''Jake: Well, we're actually looking for some work right now. We just got into town from Miami.
Charles: Where we didn't sleep with the same prostitute.''',
          '''Charles: So, you don't know about anything that's going down at all?
Kyle Murphy: No, but if you know anyone who's looking to buy a lamp for really cheap, I know a guy.
Jake: Oh, Kyle.
Kyle Murphy: Yeah, that's it. That's how they say it.''',
          '''Captain Holt: So, did you make contact with Murphy's weak link, Diane Keaton's brother-in-law?''',
          '''Rosa: We have to get that permit.
Amy: How? The forms don't make any sense. I mean, is anything even real?
Rosa: No. Odds are we exist in a computer simulation, but I don't have time to go down that rabbit hole.''',
          '''Hitchcock: Hi, there. I'd like to humiliate some hussies, and I'm in a hurry.''',
          '''Jake: Right, except for one thing: I also put a bug in the keys.
Charles: Of course he did. Guy's got more bugs up his sleeve than Oogie Boogie.
Jake: Don't get the reference.
Charles: Nightmare Before Christmas.
Jake: Oh.''',
          '''Rosa: No, I mean when I told everyone I was bi. Was it too touchy-feely?
Jake: Rosa, no. It was great. And don't worry, just because you opened up a little bit doesn't mean everyone's gonna be less afraid of you. We're all still terrified.
Rosa: Thanks, Jake.''',
          '''Jake: Can we go in, sir?
Captain Holt: Fine, just make it quick.
Jake: Yes! Pull in over there, Argyle!
Captain Holt: What?
Jake: That's the name of the driver in the movie. We're going to Nakatomi Plaza. There's gonna be role-play.''',
          '''Jake: Oh, my God. It's even more beautiful than I imagined.
Rosa: It's an empty floor that's under construction.

Victor Santiago: We arrived at the agreed upon time.
Roger Peralta: Right. So, like, super early.''',

          '''Gina: First time back at the Nine-Nine. I really miss these people. The whole crew. Jake, Terry, bleugh. I forget all their other names.''',
          '''Lieutenant Singh: I love the way your butt looks today.
Charles: I've been doing lunges in the shower.
Rosa: Well, this got upsetting real quick.
Gina: I wanna live in this moment forever.''',
          '''Rosa: Charles, it is not like you to have sex with a total stranger.
Charles: Really? Tell that to me in an hour when we've had sex twenty-three times.''',
          '''Charles: Oh, you sweet, naive boy. I haven't even begun to start pressuring you two. I've already written my best man speech for your wedding.
Oh, I'm gonna need you to get married on a farm. A lot of my jokes rely on that.''',
          '''Rosa: I'd love to see you date someone from work. Your head would explode.
Amy: Your head would explode! Because of how well I would handle it.
Rosa: Huh, sick burn.''',
          '''Rosa: So, Boyle, let's go look at those surveillance tapes, shall we?''',
          '''Charles: This is not how you and Amy are supposed to end. You're supposed to grow old, and die holding each other as your cruise ship slowly takes on water.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Well done, sir. Welcome to the Nine-Nine. I'm Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Seth Dozerman: And I'm not interested. I have no use for people. I find people weird and confusing.''',
          '''Amy: So, how do we keep it light and breezy?
I know. A comprehensive set of rules.
Jake: How am I attracted to you? Doesn't matter. I am, go.''',
          '''Rosa: I knew just where to punch it to get free food. Now I'll have to go back to punching Hitchcock.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I want to say, it has been a pleasure to have worked alongside all of you for the past twenty-one and a half months.''',
          '''Jake: We can't let that happen. Sir, we have to do something.
Charles: Fine, I'll seduce her. I'll just put on my bike shorts and give her a glimpse of the quad cities.''',
          '''Jake: Oh man, look at the captain. He's pacing slowly. For him that's like a full on rage-fuelled freak out.
Charles: The only thing worse is when he stands perfectly still. Oh no, he's standing perfectly still.''',
          '''Jake: And don't worry, I'm just getting warmed up. I still have eight sunglass moves locked and loaded. Make that nine.''',
          '''Rosa: But we agreed to keep our personal and professional lives separate. It is weird enough I am dating your nephew without dragging your husband and dog into it.''',

Hitchcock: Nice.''',
          '''Amy: I can't believe I'm about to say this. I really wish you could come look at urine with us, but you can't. You're suspended. Go home.''',
          '''Charles: Look how cool and illegible his handwriting is. Oh, I wish I could be that free. But you know me, ever the calligrapher.''',
          '''Jake: Right, you hate him because he has a typo on his counterfeit bills.
Amy: No, because he passed 4 million dollars in fraudulent bills, Jake.
But also, two Rs in pluribus. I mean did none of those cashiers take Latin?''',
          '''Charles: What you got there? Candle, perfume, bra. Someone's dropping off a care package for mom.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: You need to destroy that stuff. You want me to crush that big box into a little ball with my bare hands?''',
          '''Amy: It was crazy assertive and I feel like maybe I don't need power pose training.
Rosa: You don't. Mostly because no one needs power pose training.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: No more loans. You already owe me way too much. The Bank of Terry is closed.
Jake: What, are you sailing away on a tugboat?
Charles: Man, I love tugboats.
Sergeant Jeffords: It's not a tugboat. I am locking the vault!''',
          '''Jake: How about this? I'll work off my debt to each of you. I'll do anything you want. How does that sound?
Scully: Anything?
Jake: Am I the only one that was super creeped out by that?
Charles: No, that was definitely creepy.
Rosa: Yeah, he wants you to do something real weird.''',
          '''Charles: You can be my god father, Jake.
Jake: You're older than me!''',

          '''Jake: You know how I'm always saying it's not a real party until your boss shows up unexpectedly? Well, it's a party!''',
          '''Jake: You guys are being a bunch of homophobic, racist, golf cops!''',
          '''Charles: Mmm, texting. That's the most intimate thing you can do to a lover with your fingers. Other than washing their hair.''',
          '''Gina: The captain's making a toast. Don't be rude, prude.
Amy: Okay, I guess I'll have one more.
Captain Holt: You're on vacation. Who's counting?
Gina: *Whispers* I am.''',

Charles: What are we gonna do? How do you cheer up granite?''',
          '''Scully: Hey, Boyle. I smell burning. Is Hitchcock roasting corn on the radiator again?
Charles: No. What you smell is the burning wreckage of my relationship with Holt.
Scully: So there's no corn on the cob?''',
          '''Charles: You take care of Amy.
Gina: But how to make it look like an accident?
Charles: I'm not saying murder. Just talk to her like a normal person.
Gina: Right, even better. Get her to tell me all her little secrets, then if she tries anything we can destroy her.''',
          '''Charles: He could be in Canada by now. There's so many forests up there. That country is one giant hiding place.''',
          '''Charles: I got aroused last night watching a nature documentary on bees. I was fine until they went inside the hive.''',
          '''Jake: I don't know what's gonna happen on this assignment, and if something bad goes down, I think I'd be pissed at myself if I didn't say this.
I kinda wish something could happen, between us, romantic styles.''',
          '''Jake: How did you manage to step on both of my feet at the same time?''',
          '''Jake: Ah, Commissioner Podolski. It's been a while.
Commissioner Podolski: Maybe because you haven't put any of my children in handcuffs recently.
Jake: Yay. Enemies for life.''',
          '''Jake: Okay, but just so you know, I think you're both wrong. Self dismissed.''',
          '''Amy: How can you not trust Holt? He's the executor of my will.''',
          '''Jake: Look, let's just agree to say I'm Sorry on the count of three. One, two, three.
See? Now, I'm just disappointed in both of us.''',
          '''Gina: Our friendship is little-boy holding little-girl's hand.''',
          '''Gina: Okay, but if you do lie, you can't go wrong with dental emergency. Or death of a triplet. Now, that one you can use twice. Smart.''',
          '''Jake: Now I'm telling my friend how you killed that guy.
Perp: It was for love.
Jake: Cool motive. Still murder.''',
          '''Charles: If I was a unicorn, I'd never be angry.''',
          '''Amy: Sorry? You bumbling son of a bitch. You just ruined my life. I hope you get hit by a truck and a dog takes a dump on your face.
Sergeant Jeffords: Nothing to see here. Just a little hypoglycaemic rage. Move along.''',

Jake: Jesuit. Horticulture. Lamb.''',

Gina: Uh, but never married once. Game, set, match. Linetti.''',

Jake: Trying to save electricity, Gina.
Gina: Your massage chair is on.
Jake: Yeah, I'm poor. I'm not a savage.''',

Jake: Well they don't make a massage couch.''',

Aww, samesies!''',

Captain Holt: The bathroom.
Sergeant Jeffords: If people are afraid to walk by Diaz, bathroom breaks will be to a minimum.''',

          '''Charles: Are you sure I shouldn't go get him? I feel a little uncomfortable leaving him out of this.
Jake: Don't think of this as leaving him out, so much as including his babies in having a father.''',
          '''Rosa: What's the matter with you?
Amy: Gina came by my house last night to go over the case. Between us doing that and her using my bread maker all night, I didn't get much sleep. I will say she makes a wonderful rye. So dense yet so moist.''',
          '''Jake: And you'll be happy to know that he punched me in the face several times.
Captain Holt: That does make me happy.
Jake: Guess we're being candid today.''',
          '''Jake: Oh, sir, are you looking for your glasses? I borrowed them to do an impression of you. It killed.''',
          '''Jake: If you want to worry about anyone panicking in the field, it'd be Boyle.
Charles: Damn straight.
Wait, why did I high five that?
Jake: Because you're a sucker for a high five.
Charles: Damn straight I am.''',
          '''Jake: Are you ready sarge?
Sergeant Jeffords: I was born ready. And then I was not ready for a while. Now I'm back to being born ready.''',
          '''Rosa: We swept the scene, ran the prints, canvassed the building. We followed procedure.
Gina: Procedure is just a fancy word for proper order to do things.
Captain Holt: Yes, that is its definition.''',
          '''Charles: I spent forty-minutes making that water bottle display. This guy's a psycho.''',
          '''Jake: They'll sing to her at midnight in the middle of Time Square. She and five hundred German tourists will savor that memory for all times.''',
          '''Jake: Oh. Sir. I'm right in the middle of this date and I can not reschedule. I have far, far too many non-refundable deposits. I'm renting a tiger cub by the hour.
Captain Holt: For what?
Jake: Don't even know. Waiting for inspiration.''',
          '''Amy: Now, the Captain won't allow us to give him all the presents we bought him.
Rosa: You are the only one that did that.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Anything else?
Jake: Yes. What cute little nickname do you call your Husband?
Captain Holt: Kevin.
Jake: Adorable.''',
          '''Charles: So this is your lunch for, like, the month?
Sergeant Jeffords: I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain muscle mass. My wife made me all of this before she left town with the kids. That was everything in my fridge.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Can I help you, Santiago?
Amy: Oh, captain. I didn't expect to see you there.
Captain Holt: In my office?''',
          '''Captain Holt: Hey. What are you all doing here?
Rosa: Amy broke everything and got us kicked out of the bar. Then, we got attacked by rats. It's the best Thanksgiving ever.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Fine. How about this guy?
Gina: No, that guy was scared of everything! Do you remember Rosa's reaction last time the printer jammed?''',
          '''Rosa: It's whack, and you know it! Their number one crime is tricycle theft. There's a bakery attached to the precinct.''',
          '''Charles: Rosa, I think you're nervous.
Rosa: Of course I'm nervous. What did you think was wrong?
Sergeant Jeffords: We just assumed you were a terrifying human being with a short fuse.
Charles: But if the problem is that you're nervous, that's where Charles Boyle lives, baby.''',
          '''Rosa: Is this why you were getting make-up tips from the prostitute in the holding cell?
Amy: I just wanted to know how she got such smoky eyes. Turns out it was an STD rash.''',
          '''Jake: I want to brush my teeth.
Charles: Jake, it's been in my mouth!
Amy: That's the grossest thing I've ever heard!
Jake: That's the grossest thing you've ever heard? You caught a guy on the subway with a bag of human ears!
Amy: Your thing's grosser.''',
          '''Gina: Do whatever you want, but most women don't really like it when dudes lie to them. Except for me, but I'm wired to thrive on dysfunction.''',

Amy: Yes, I will do that.
Captain Holt: Are you bowing?
Amy: No, this is how I walk.''',

          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Where do I affix the Princess Tower, Boyle? Where do I affix it?!
Charles: By the side of the turret-
Sergeant Jeffords: Not now, Boyle. Let a brother breathe. Let a brother breathe.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: I'm a man with man-hands and a man-brain. I should be able to put together a doll house in less than four hours.''',
          '''Gina: I'm 23, I'm a celebrity, and today, I'm gonna die!
Rosa: Not one word of that is true.''',
          '''Rosa: Amy?
Amy: How long have you known?
Rosa: Since seventh grade. I was watching "Saved by the Bell" and I thought, Zack Morris is hot. And then I thought Lisa Turtle, also hot.
Jake: The fact that the words Kelly and Kapowski didn't just come out of your mouth is lunacy.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I must say, this is going considerably better than when I came out to my colleagues. They were not, as the kids say, awake.
Jake: Do you mean woke?
Captain Holt: I did mean woke. But it's grammatically incoherent.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Yes, yes, babies are adorable. They're like we are but so much smaller.''',
          '''Gina: Mm, thanks for saying that, and I don't know, uh You know what? You can have your blackmail files back. I don't want 'em anymore.
Amy: Gina, these are just photos of me in my everyday clothes.
Gina: [CHUCKLES] I know. It's painful, right?''',
          '''Gina: It's been over an hour. This has to be a record for longest childbirth.''',
          '''Captain Holt: I came out as a gay cop in the 1980s, so it's going to take more than reassigning me to break my spirit.
I'll turn this place around, just like I did the Nine-Nine.''',
          '''Amy: Oh my God, did you hear that George W. Bush died?
Gina: Who dat?''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Reminder. Tomorrow, we are hosting a field trip for the Brooklyn Park Magnet school.
Scully: Sorry, Sarge. I can't be around magnets; pacemaker.
Sergeant Jeffords: I'm actually not going to correct you on that.''',
          '''Jake: So, good news first. We're gonna be flying back past a beautiful sunset. Bad news, Bludsoe escaped from the hospital and we're all screwed.''',
          '''Charles: If you'll excuse me, sir, I have to make urines in the toilets.
Jake: Yep, that's how people say words.''',
          '''Captain Holt: What's going on? Why do you all have matching bags?
Sergeant Jeffords: We're doing a diet together. My wife found it. She heard about it at Mommy and Me graphic design. Wait, it might have been toddler karate.''',
          '''Charles: We can fill his locker with shaving cream and loose hair.
Rosa: I like it. I cannot believe that I'm considering a non-violent option.''',
          '''Jake: She has tenure, and also has ten years - times two - older than him.
Rosa: That sucked.
Jake: Yeah.''',
          '''Charles: You know, the doctor said if the bullet was two millimetres to the left and a foot higher, I might never have walked again.''',
          '''Charles: All this cycling makes me feel like Lance Armstrong.
Gina: Like you use performance-enhancing drugs and have one testicle?
Charles: Wouldn't you like to know?''',
          '''Charles: Hey, Sarge. This cast has a specially crotch hole. It's a like a Doggie Door for my penis. Shake?''',
          '''Amy: Ooh, more work! I know that sounded sarcastic-
Sergeant Jeffords: Nobody thought that.
Captain Holt: Not for a moment.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: If you guys don't get back to work, I'm gonna start firing detectives.
Amy: And blanks! Sorry, I just never think of jokes.''',
          '''Jake: I am playing a character: a no-nonsense detective whose only goal is to set this course's record. His name is Vic Kovak, he's an ex-Navy seal who was double crossed and left for dead.
I don't want to go into his backstory.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Gina! We've been looking all over for you. You can't just disappear and leave a sign on your desk that says "Gone leavin".''',
          '''Jake: Okay, so the perp came in through the window, left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had sex with the dish rack.''',
          '''Amy: So, only Captain Holt or Terry can initiate actual blackout protocol, but I don't see them anywhere.
Jake: Guys? Where did our dads go?''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Wait, look at this, sir. I think we'll be fine. It was inspected four months ago.
Captain Holt: By Walter Beverly, the clown prince of the Department of Buildings. You've made it so much worse. Help!''',
          '''Jake: Yeah, they're trapped in there.
Rosa: Oh no, that means we have to call the fire department. [gags]
Jake: Or, hear me out, we leave them in there forever, and move on emotionally.''',

Jake: I mean, you're a grown man with your own hopes and dreams.
Charles: My purpose is clear.
Jake: Okay.''',
          '''Jake: Wait, wait, wait, stop! The power's back.
Kayla: Oh, yuck, none of you are cute with the lights fully on.
Charles: You wanna play mean girl, Kayla? Two can play at that game. Let's talk about your bangs.''',
          '''Jake: [on the phone] You're giving birth at the precinct? Is that safe?

Amy: Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of something, you [long bleep]!
Hitchcock: Oh yeah? Well [bleep] yourself!''',

Charles: Uncle Charles it is.''',
          '''Jake: It just doesn't seem like he should be that fast for how big he is. Gah, I hate Wario.''',

Kevin: They did, but that doesn't matter anymore. Nothing does. Cheddar has been kidnapped.''',

Jake: Look, Raymond. A yellow crested warbler.
Captain Holt: Ugh, not excited enough. They may be common, but they're still birds.''',
          '''Amy: Okay, I'll go next. I have... [chuckles] Geppetto?
Jake: Yeah.
Amy: Ugh, that must be Charles.
Charles: It is because I'm the puppeteer, and you're all my little puppets.
Amy: Ugh. Can we choke our partner to death with our handcuffs?
Jake: Sure, choke away.''',

Jake: We're coworkers involved in an elaborate Halloween heist. Do you seriously not talk to your vet about us?''',
          '''Dr. Gabbie Wince: No, no, no, no, there's no need to operate. The gems are small enough. He should be able to excrete them without discomfort.

Rosa: It is not.
Jake: Hm?''',
          '''Amy: It's happening. Put on your head.

Roger Peralta: Oh, God. Oh, God. Ah... Get the "Dino Bites."''',
          '''Captain Holt: And I believe that's all I've got. Oh, wait, there's one more thing. Peralta gave me a note before the meeting. Ugh, the penmanship is horrid, but I think it says, "Ask if anyone has an anal mint."
Jake: It's announcements, and we do.
Charles: Wow, what an entrance.''',
          '''Roger Peralta: Aw, Jake. I am excited that you're having a kid.

Charles: Elton John.
Jake: What?
Charles: You said "sir," and that's on you.''',

Jake: And, not to be rude, but is that something you can normally feel?
Scully: Oh, right. I guess I'm fine.''',
          '''Sergeant Jeffords: Look at this. There's a note. It says, "Gotcha back, babe." It was Amy. Who else would call Jake "babe"?

Charles: I forget. Did you guys like that?
All: No.''',
          '''Dillman: Interesting squad you have here, Raymond.
Captain Holt: I didn't choose them. They were here when I arrived.
Dillman: Understood.''',

Jake: A place where you paint pottery?
Doug Judy: I find a hand-painted mug makes a thoughtful gift for any occasion.''',

Jake: No! Why didn't you invite me?
Doug Judy: I wanted to, but a lot of people in my life are crooks and they think it's weird that I'm friends with a cop. They just don't understand. Kind of like... parents?
Jake: No, no more songs.''',
          '''Amy: Okay, look. Why don't you get a few options together and then I'll decide, okay? At least Terry's not here to try to make me get a yogurt machine.
Sergeant Jeffords: What was that about yogurt?''',

Doug Judy: Then let's get changed, boys!
Jake: Changed? But these are my coolest clothes. I got them from a targeted Instagram ad after looking at photos of Cam Newton.''',
          '''Trudy Judy: I knew it was a mistake to invite a cop. That's why you should only interact with people who are exactly the same as you.
Jake: That's a terrible lesson.
Trudy Judy: Sometimes things aren't lessons. Sometimes things are just messed up facts.''',
          '''Captain Holt: Hmm. It's a little less pink than I recall. But I suppose we exaggerate the beauty of those we love. It's good to have you back, old friend.''',

Charles: Maybe she's alive.''',

Captain Holt: Yep. Wanna see the selfies I took?
Rosa: Actually, yes.
Captain Holt: I'll share the album with you.''',
          '''Captain Holt: So you were right. Wuntch was not able to claw through her coffin and write the email herself. It turns out, the lawyer for her estate sent it.''',

Rosa: Dude, you're bumming us out.''',
          '''Captain Holt: All right. Uh, the email contains a link to a video. I'm going to play it. Brace yourselves. If it shows Madeline, be sure not to look directly into her eyes.
Rosa: Because we'll turn to stone?
Captain Holt: No. Because her eyes are ugly.''',
          '''Amy: Look, since you can't say anything nice, try saying the opposite of whatever you're thinking.
Captain Holt: Interesting. I'll give it a whirl. Madeline Wuntch was... A friend.
Rosa: See? It's not that hard to say something ni... Oh, you're vomiting.
Captain Holt: [barfing]''',
          '''Captain Holt: That man is lying. I don't believe Wuntch had another rival. I saw it in her eyes. She only had hate for me.
Rosa: Are you jealous?
Captain Holt: Of course I am. I despised her with my entire being while she was only despising me with a fraction of hers?''',
          '''Adam Jarver: Wow, that speech would have been amazing. I had to look up what a toilet ghost was.
Captain Holt: Uh, yes, I took a trip to Korea just to research a new Wuntch insult. In fact it's been a motivation for most of my international travel.''',
          '''Captain Holt: [on video] Madeline Wuntch will not soon be forgotten. Trick or Treaters will dress like her for generations.''',
          '''Adam Jarver: You hired actors?
Captain Holt: Worse. They're members of local improv troupes, and they did it for "the exposure."

Rosa: No. Sit down.''',
          '''Amy: So just to be clear, this service is actually real, right?
Captain Holt: Oh, yes. I figured if I needed two fake memorials to smoke out Wuntch's plan, she deserved to win, but she didn't win. I did. Finally beat the old fishwife.''',

Scully: Because we're the boys.''',

          '''Jake: So you still annoyed?
Amy: Yes. You can't keep saying "mischief managed" after we finish sex.

Charles: Obviously.''',

Sergeant Jeffords: I didn't let you!''',

Amy: Right, yes. That is a very real possibility.''',
          '''Captain Holt: And if the shooter's watching, I hope you like living between St. Charles Place and Connecticut Avenue.

Hitchcock: I guess it's unrelated.''',

Jake: I.e. "mangled." Continue.''',
